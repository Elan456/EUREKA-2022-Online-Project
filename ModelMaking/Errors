0 Me: *enables skill*3yo: *Call Elmo*Elmo: * {Fuzzy, high-pitched audio that forensic scientists could not possibly discern into speech} *3yo, looking at me with confused look: *What's he say?"Me: He said it's time to disable this skill.I do love Sesame Street, but there are probably better representatives than Elmo, and definitely characters that are easier to understand.  In any case, like several story-time skills the audio is too poor for anybody to understand. 1

7 I have Ring and Alexa successfully linked. I have a wired doorbell and a wireless one. The wired one will not ring reliably ring even if the ring is lit and white with a full battery.  IF (not reliable in the least) the ring camera recognizes someone at my door there is less than a 50% chance there will be a notification on my Alexa devices. If someone rings my doorbell there is less than a 50% chance my Alexa Shows will actually display the camera. If I ask Alexa to show my front door there is a 3 second delay while it tries to connect to Ring.Com.  Usually it connects in another 3-4 seconds, sometimes it does not.  The wired camera only actually displays about 25% of the time. That one should be more reliable than the wireless one, but it is not. 1
10 Tried it twice. Got "practice piano" twice. Don't own a piano. Don't even understand how that's a chore. 1
11 Very fun , first listening to “Word of the Day” then going to “ Word of the day quiz” I put word of the day last in my flash briefing so that when it is finished i can pop into the quiz immediately . One tiny little complaint is Scarlett’s voice sometimes muffles or garbels , , it could be just a little hard to understand.  It is not your fault but Alexa’s voice over which might cause this issue. However am pleased that you added the spelling into both. Great two skills from peppercorn media. blessings 1
