B074XGLD4V,INFINITI InTouch™ Services,Connected Car,David Martin,1.0 out of 5 stars,Too Frustrating to Actually Use,"Reviewed in the United States on June 17, 2019","The app continually unlinks from my account.  Once linked, the command to start the car is so convoluted.  My wife has a 2016 Buick Enclave with OnStar.  All she has to say is ""Alexa start my Buick"".  Alexa will ask for the PIN code and then send the command.  It works every time.  I can NEVER simply say ""Alexa start my Inifiniti"".  Why not?  Well I know why not....this skill is badly written and needs to be redone from the ground up."
B074XGLD4V,INFINITI InTouch™ Services,Connected Car,Asdf Asdf Asdf,1.0 out of 5 stars,You have to say your pin out loud... security failure,"Reviewed in the United States on March 31, 2018","- The phrasing is ridiculously long and tedious.- It asks for your pin, out loud... awful. The only option here is to make it a trivial pin like 1111. But now you've compromised security twice b/c app makers can't think through the consequences of requiring an audible pin.I would rather it just do as i say:1. To access alexa on phone, you must unlock the phone already.2. To access alexa at home, must already be in my house.3. Even w/it remote started, car cannot be driven w/o keys and pressing start. Even if somebody did remote start, it stays locked and automatically shuts down if nobody starts with key."

Iseman,1.0 out of 5 stars,One best hope that Elexa has a carbon monoxide detector when ...,"Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2018",I'm a Infiniti owner but not of this particular 'function'.  I truly believe that Infiniti has lost their mind.  One best hope that Elexa has a carbon monoxide detector when she starts that QX50 after forgetting to open the garage door first.......nice way for your new car to exterminate the entire family.  Wonder if Elexa can phone the police and tell them your entire family is dead.  These gadgets that are finding their ways to our automobiles are dangerous and quite unwanted and unnecessary.  Get real Infiniti and spend some money on a new design to set your cars apart from the competition; not by gadgets but by real innovation.

You see, there are two ways that I could go to work and I could take a different way based on gas prices, but I'm not going to go all the way to Peabody to get gas and that is what it told me when I asked for cheapest gas, and when I asked in Swampscott, it told me the average price.. Now, google has my work and home address and tells me what the traffic is on the route, if you could tell me what the gas prices are on approximately equivalent routes, that would be great. Barring that, a list that says, the Mobil on Paradise road is x, the Shell on Essex is y, the Gibbs by the beach is z, then I could  base my travel route on that. Now, I have a Show and a Dot, and I could put this on my Alexa, Good Morning routine. Right now I don't have Alexa in the car, but I signed up to be one of the first ones to get it, but so far, no joy."

Maybe we don't have all the same features or options, but it would be very easy to just limit older models, such as my 2017 Pacifica, to Start, Lock and Unlock, as an example.I could maybe understand not including 7-8 year old models, but models from only 2 years ago?

B07DD2VGFS,Jeep,Connected Car,Kmuda,4.0 out of 5 stars,Does what it says it does > Not sure why the bad experiences,"Reviewed in the United States on January 30, 2021","I have a 2020 Grand Cherokee. I say ""Alexa, ask Jeep to start my car"", it asks me for my pin code, which I provide, and it starts my car. Of course, there is a speed of light delay while the request goes up to the satellite and back down to my vehicle... maybe 30 seconds, but the car is started, the doors unlocked or locked, whatever. I'm not sure why there are  so any negative experiences. It was a simple install, app is easy to use, does what it says it does. Maybe because I started with a 2020 Vehicle and the most current version of the app?  I had installed the Jeep and UConnect apps on my phone and had them working before I installed this skill, so perhaps that played a role in function? The remote start is nice in the winter. I wish it would allow you to lower your windows in the summer.  It is very nice when laying in bed at night and you get that feeling... did I lock my car doors? Just say, ""Alexa. ask Jeep to lock my car"". Single prompt asking for your Pin, provide that information, say yes when it validates the vehicle you are trying to lock, and it gets locked. Don't have to get out of bed, rumble around for your keys, and goto the nearest window to use the remote. Just say the command and go to sleep. Same for when your wife asks you to unlock the car so she can get something out of i. Just say ""Alexa, ask Jeep to unlock my car"", provide the pin when prompted, tell it yes on the confirmation, and go on about your business."

It works fine but you have to answer so many questions and provide so much information verbally to Alexa before doing so that it is almost easier to take the elevator down five floors and go do it by hand....it should work just by saying “Alexa, start my Jeep!” Instead I have to answer four questions and provide a PIN.

B07DD2VGFS,Jeep,Connected Car,Chaplain Dan,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Useful, But Check Updates","Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2022","After almost a year, the skill suddenly stopped working. I had linked it through my Jeep account on the Jeep website, but my login through the Jeep app kept kicking me out of the app, so I couldn't relink. I uninstalled the app, and when I went to the playstore, I saw that the Jeep app was now the Jeep Connect app. After installing it, I had to create my account all over, relink, and reauthorize. Now it's working fine again. It was a Jeep app change/update that caused the problems, not the Jeep skill. I have noticed in the past that I sometimes need to relink after Alexa updates, which seems to be about every 7-8 days sometimes. If the skill could somehow stay linked after every update to the app & Alexa, I'd give it 5 stars. As is, it worth the relinking issue, just for the things it does. I can start or lock up without going to grab my remote fob, check my gas & tires before I head out, and get alexa to find an address & send it to my Gladitor's GPS. All in all it's a pretty cool skill."
B07DD2VGFS,Jeep,Connected Car,Nik P,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Misleading, you might need the uConnect skill instead","Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2020","Jeep uses uConnect to work. I have a 2015 Grand Cherokee and it doesn’t work with this app, and I think it’s because this app requires SirusXm guardian (which my vehcile doesn’t support).If you have trouble with this skill, try enabling the Uconnect skill instead. This worked for me, I obviously needed to make sure that I had an active uConnect subscription first (if you can’t remote start from your phone app - don’t expect this skill to work lol).One star rating because now that i’ve enabled this skill ONE TIME to try, saying “Alexa, start my jeep” prompts me to re-enable this incompatable skill every time. It’s annoying to have to say “Alexa, ASK UCONNECT TO start my jeep” - thats just more words. Also that’s annoying that i can’t use the JEEP skill to start my JEEP... like for real? 😓"

The downside is that, at any given time, the app will unpair with Alexa and I have to go into the Alexa app, manually, and pair it again. Usually when that happens, i just use my Uconnect app and pair it to Alexa when I can. I am hopeful that this can be worked out, despite it happening for almost two years."

It would be nice if there was a way to skip the prompts - I have an alexa routine to ""warm up my car"" that opens my garage and opens the jeep skill.But then I have to listen to the prompts and indicate I want to start my car, then give my PIN, then confirm I do in fact want to start my 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee (which is the only car in my account).  If I could somehow skip all the prompts that would be perfect - the confirmation regarding starting my car is the most annoying because there is only one vehicle in my account and I provided my PIN so yes, I do want to start my car, thank you."

Also make sure you are using the correct app for your model and year car. I initially denied the location permission but then enabled it - I don't know if this is required. This is only day 1, but I'm finding I'm extremely spoiled by Google homes and assistant. Some very simple commands like ""ask Dodge to lock my car"" were not recognized 3 times in a row. It sometimes takes a long time for commands to get to the car but that is probably mopar's issue since their own app takes a long time too. I don't trust this skill a whole lot yet but it's been okay. There is WAY too much back and forth with Alexa - it would be nice if you could just say your command and give your pin at the same time rather than having a huge long conversation. As it stands now it's a lot easier to just use the key fob, but this skill is a neat option. 2019 Charger."

I specify this because the Alexa App on my iPhone still told me the other skill needed attention (linking with my Uconnect account) even after I removed it from the web interface. Either way, once you learn ""How to talk to it (""Ask Dodge to start my truck"")"" it works flawlessly. I even sent directions with the app. Help is available at any time."

B07DD1LS7Z,RAM,Connected Car,DZee,3.0 out of 5 stars,Works and Wordy,"Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2020","Like many on here, I find the process too wordy for convenience.  The commands are unnatural as well:  ""Ask RAM to start my car?"" is given as an example.  What car?  How would my RAM vehicle start my car?  How about just ""Alexa, Start RAM""?I don't mind the confirmation but we all know trucks have a lot of emblems on them.  I can't wait all day for it to say, ""Do you want to start your White 2019 RAM Laramie Long Horn Classic Long Bed Club Cab 8' Bed Diesel Power Wagon Pickup Truck you bought about a year ago with Sidesteps, Towing Package, Spare Tire, Bed Lights, and a bug on the windshield?""  OK, I'm kidding.  That's hyperbole.  But it does seem like you may have accidentally asked Alexa to read the War and Peace audio book.I think the other problem is after I say a command out loud, I have to say my pin out loud, too.  Hardly a 2FA solution, particularly if you're speaking into your cell phone in a public place, and if you're in your home you don't need that.  It would be nice if the command comes from Alexa at home it didn't need the extra step.Because of all this, I don't use it often, but unlike a few others on here, mine worked."

Is anyone out there listening?!?!?UPDATE: After several attempts to contact all parties involved (Alexa, UConnect, SiriusXM Guardian, etc). Something was finally reset on my account by someone and all services work. FINALLY!  They are somewhat faster than the UConnect commands too. I still think the skill is too wordy and wish it was more streamlined, but I hope they are working on that now. It would be nice to just be able to say, “Alexa, start my truck” or “Alexa, lock my truck”.  Still needs improvements, but at least it works for me now."

I have tried to sign in on Multiple devices with the mopar telling me that I do not have an account registered. so my question is why on this green earth would someone roll out an update that doesn’t even work as it was ment to and take away all functionlty of the app. As im getting very disapointed with amazon alexa products, they sumetimes work or not work at all. I think that I might have to give google a try I hear that they are a little more solid in proformance. they won’t let you leave 0 stars for this app so im forced to give it 1 star."
B07DD1LS7Z,RAM,Connected Car,Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible experience,"Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2022","Bought the 2022 Ram 1500 Bighorn. The documentation and listed features say that this is offered with the truck with a free trial. That I can control my truck from in the house using the Alexa Echo. When it didn’t work I called support and got transferred from one department to another. Went out to the dealership and they called their support number and got the same experience of being transferred from one department to another. They gave me a case number to call when I got home.When I got home and called the support number they said that the case number was closed and that I would have to start over. This went on for almost 3 months with all the running around. Every time I would get someone that was very, very hard to understand with a thick accent of one kind or another and the communication was terrible. Finally today I get someone that is able to communicate well and after putting me on hold for a while to research the issue she comes back on and informs me that the Alexa feature hasn’t been implemented in the 2022 models of the Ram 1500s.I asked her, “What about my free trial? That was the main thing I wanted to test out to see if I even want to keep it.” Of course she tells me that the trial will be over by the time the Alexa feature is implemented and that I will have to pay for a subscription to test it out. 3 months of being jerked around just to find out that it hasn’t been implemented yet.All in all it was a very frustrating and unpleasant experience."

However my password didn't work so I had to reset it. After this, I still could not login as I keep getting account error with the email they just sent my password reset to.

B07DD1LS7Z,RAM,Connected Car,jeddah Deloria,2.0 out of 5 stars,needs more usability testing,"Reviewed in the United States on March 13, 2019",way too many interactions needed to get a simple task completed. I assume the desired benefit of voice comman via alexa was to create efficency but i can honestly use my phone app to do these tasks quicker (at least twice as fast).at this time it seems more like a novelty than a time saver. it takes 4+ interactions with alexas drawn out sentances in order to get a basic task complete. I would suggest making the request available at all times vs having to open the app before basic requests such as “how much fuel is in my truck” are available.The skill has potential but usability is low.

You have to enable the skill and link you account. The only reason I deducted a star was it asks you for a pin and then asks you to confirm you wish to start your 2019 Ram one-thousand five-hundred.

Yes, it is a bit wordy but the command was easy (""Alexa, ask RAM to start my truck"").  I have no issue with the response confirming my gray one thousand five hundred"" and the PIN gave it extra security.Truck started within 5 minutes which is the same as it takes with UConnect.  The downside to me is that you need multiple apps.  Why UConnect and RAM/MOPAR are different Apps is a mystery other than each brand wants your email (Sirius and RAM) and I actually think it is a MOPAR account now instead of RAM."

Starting and locking did work, however each use requires the PIN be spoken out loud.  Thats stupid and makes using the skill tedious and really useless if you have to annouce your PIN outloud on each use.  It should allow setup of predefined PIN so to allow a setting of ask or dont ask for PIN. Not a good skill so far. Needs lots of work."

I went to Rams login page where I logged into my account. It then prompted me to finish my account set up on Mopar's site. On the Mopar's site dashboard I noticed my truck said ""Non Owner"". This is what was causing the problem. My address was not filled in. After updating my profile with the address associated with my registration my truck switched to ""Owner"" status and I could see my active guardian subscription. Then navigated back to the Ram login page where the information looked updated as well (except it says no vehicles on the ram page) and once logged in and linked I was able to get it working again.

Some may say for the wrong reasons, but any truck can do what I need a truck for, so the tech was the differentiation. I didn't realize this function even existed until the other day when my kid told me...I think you can use Alexa on your new truck Dad. Not sure how I didn't know about it, we have several Alexa devices and use them a lot. I find a lot of the Alex things to be somewhat less than perfect. Call it low expectations, but think about where we were ten, fifteen, twenty years ago...this stuff is AMAZING. I see people complaining about the PIN thing. I kinda get the argument, but if you don't trust the people around you, use your phone app. I'm guessing the logic behind the pin is to prevent intrusion. I think sitting around the couch saying anything (PIN, ask FordPass etc.) is way more convenient than reaching for your phone, key FOB or worse...going outside...so 1980's. All kidding aside, maybe not perfect, but good enough to get a 5 star rating out of me. I found it easy to setup and it has worked every time I've showed it off to friends and family. Keep it coming Ford and Amazon."

I did not have any issues linking the vehicle (2018 Explorer) with FordPass or setting up the skill.  Got the app working first, then added the Alexa skill, and bam it worked.I am however very disappointed that it requires a PIN every time you issue a command.  I mean really, whats the point.  Every time I use it, I would have to change the PIN.  My PIN as audibly heard by everyone around me whenever I use the skill and then saved in Amazons recordings which recently have not been very secure.  Requiring the PIN actually makes the system less secure.  So the only thing this feature does it annoy the user and make the skill more difficult to use.Skills should be simple: Alexa, ask FordPass to start my TruckRemove the need for the PIN, and I might use this skill."

I asked my son to use it once and Alexa didn’t understand him when he said the pin, so it locked us out of the skill. It is just annoying. The skill works the majority of the time after we get through the pin, but the 2 stars are for making this more difficult than it needs to be.

B077Y1FK9D,FordPass,Connected Car,LapDRx,5.0 out of 5 stars,A very useful app,"Reviewed in the United States on March 6, 2021","Setting this up was a snap (When I figured it out). Even got Alexa to start my car with skills (""Alexa, ask FordPass to start my car"" was a little long) The pin, though, could use a overhaul. Face recog, thumbprint, or voice recognition would be so much better than rattling of a pin every time. And it could be a security issue. The charging station part is iffy. Sometimes it works, other times not. It will say, ""Now charging."" That is fine. Asking Alexa to stop charging. That's the trick. She don't. And I learned the hard way not to ask her to stop charging. (It costs money to charge a Fusion EV, when the free charge is over). Open trunk command would be useful too. All the features this thing has, it misses there. Especially, when you need it. (Weather. Enough said). All in all it is a very useful app. I think those out there with issues, most might be an ID ten T issue. I had this error at first."

B079TYHCYX,myChevrolet,Connected Car,Nobleone,2.0 out of 5 stars,So so skill,"Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2018","In my opinion the whole point of automation, like Alexa skills, is the convenience of it.  Making the minutiae simple and easy.  I actually expected  “Alexa, Start my truck” to work “out of the box”.  Much to my surprise, it doesn’t.  Not only is my truck required to be called a car, but instead I must engage in a conversation with Alexa to start my truck.  Alexa, ask myChevrolet to start my car. Alexa replies okay, start you car, what is your pin? And I must give her a PIN number to start my truck.  All of that or I could click the button on my remote?  Can I put it into a routine, so that it starts my truck when I start my morning?  Nope. I feel like either I or whoever wrote this skill is totally missing the point."

B079TYHCYX,myChevrolet,Connected Car,G-Man,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works great! A vocal, no hands/device dream!","Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2020","This works very well.  I have 1 Chevy 2018 vehicle linked to MyChevrolet App (You must have the OnStar Tech Package, which costs monthly after a free trial period, that allows app to work).  If you can't lock/unlock/start/stop your vehicle from out of range of your key fob (like from your office inside a building) this skill won't work.I have 2 Echo Dot's (3rd Gen), 5"" Echo Show (newest gen as of 2020), 10"" Echo Show (2020 2nd Gen w/ Zigbee hub).  This does what I ask, I have no problems with Alexa understanding. (FYI -  I have The 10inch Show with Zigbee hub, which was installed over a year after me just having the 2 Echo Dots.  So the Zigbee hub has nothing to do with this skill working correctly.)  While some reviews may say;It takes more time than the app) seem to also mention problems with Alexa understanding and having to repeat, I DO NOT HAVE THAT PROBLEM!  Alexa understands everything I ask (90-95% of time), for all the skills I have set.  Having my hands and phone/device free to do other things is very benificial.  For instance, while I am getting dressed for work in the morning, I can still ask Alexa to start my car, without me ever stopping getting dressed!  To me it is a time saver, but we all multi-task differently.  I also like getting changed from work to home clothes and ask Alexa to lock my car, when I forget!  To each their own though :)The MyChevrolet App with the OnStar Tech package combined with this skill is really great!  I do use the My Chevrolet App by itself, like at my office when I don't  have an Alexa device around, and other than tyimg up my hands and usually phone,  it works great!  This just gives you vocal command of your vehicle from your home and  the Alexa App (never tried vocal directly through App), just vocally on all my different Echo's. I highly recommend this skill if you have/use the MyChevrolet App and the OnStar Tech package!Great job Amazon!"
B079TYHCYX,myChevrolet,Connected Car,C. Woodward,2.0 out of 5 stars,"App requires multiple interactions steps, no way to disable PIN or remember it.","Reviewed in the United States on January 16, 2020","I love the idea of using voice commands to start my car in the morning before I head out the door.  It's easier than fishing my keys or phone out of a pocket and doing the multi-button dance to enable pre-warm.  At least it should be.  Instead, I have to ask a very specific question to Alexa of ""ask Chevrolet to start my car"".  If I ask it to just ""start my car,"" it's not sure how, and sometimes it confirms Chevrolet is enabled, and asks if I want to start it.  If it works, it then asks ""whats your pin?""  Yes... That's something I want to shout across the house, so anyone inside (or possibly listening outside if a window is open) can hear.  Super secure that!  Why bother having a pin at all if you require people to yell it out every morning?If you allow Alexa to remember the pin, I may start using it again (and up the rating).  Otherwise, I'm going to delete it and bar access, since it's frankly unusable the way it is in most cases."

My major problem is that, unless I'm missing something, there seems to be no confirmation of commands being successful or failing. Telling the app to start my car and having no way of knowing whether it actually did isn't very useful when you can't see the car. This is where it can't replace the MyChevrolet app, unfortunately OnStar commands fail sometimes, and without knowing the result you aren't going to try again. Ideally the skill would automatically report back the result, or add another voice command to check the previous command's response. It would also be great to add a few of the other app options like checking fuel range and tire pressures, but these are secondary."

I then have to repeat my request, and only then does it work.I blame this on the VW developers, because their app is also annoyingly difficult to use & feature-free.  T start my car with the app, I have to login *3 times in a row* — once for the app, once for my only registered vehicle, and once again, with my PIN, to start it.

But, like many, if not most, Alexa apps, the execution leaves a lot to be desired. There are no real settings to speak of. Hitting the launch button doesn't make sense. If I'm going that deep into the time consuming, cumbersome, and extremely buggy aleax app, I could have just used the car-net app instead.I recall setting a pin. I know exactly what the pin is. But, Alexa tells me that it's wrong. Now, I can't recall how to go in and change the pin because the Alexa app isn't intuitive. I'll have to play with it or stumble across it. Why don't app developers have real end-users in mind? This should be straightforward. Hit setting and all the settings you need SHOULD be available."

It says on toyotas site that linking alexa with remote connect for remote start..because that's what this alexa skill is for...It says you have to have a Toyota owners account first of all and your car registered, and then you have to have a remote connect trial (activated trial) or a active subscription. Then you search Toyota alexa skill in Amazon site search box and search and then click the Toyota first thing on the top of page. Then at the top right of that page you'll see enable skill and click that and it will redirect you to the toyota owners page to sign in to your Toyota account with the email you signed up on Toyota with. Then it will ask you to set a pin for alexa. That's it, done and connected. Worked right away for me. You just gotta follow directions on toyotas website. But to activate any of toyotas car features you have to have a registered Toyota account and then download the Toyota app. The app is called Toyota (that's it) just Toyota, and make sure u download that. U can create your Toyota account through the app also. Make sure you input your vin when you make account for your car if your just now registering it.

Like every time, it spells out that entire last part.  It's quite annoying.  Can't this be fixed?It really should just say ""Thanks, I am reaching out the your corolla hatchback to turn it on"" and that would be more than enough and not grate on my nerves so much.  Just recently within the last 6 months it started pronouncing Corolla correctly (it wasn't for the longest time), so I am guessing the developers caught wind of it and fixed it.

DOES NOT SUPPORT REMOTE START!,"Reviewed in the United States on January 27, 2019","I purchased this product over another, less expensive competitor solely because it supported Amazon Alexa. The fact of the matter is, this product doesn't allow remote starting via Alexa, which is the entire reason I installed the REMOTE START system in the first place. Sure, it's nice to be able to lock and unlock your doors without hunting for the keys, but in cold New Hampshire winters, I want to be able to wake up, tell Alexa to start the truck, and go about my day. This is highly deceiving - your marketing materials should emphasize the fact that remote start isn't supported via Alexa. Perhaps this review will save another consumer from spending their hard-earned money on something that doesn't do what's implied."
B071Z28K7T,DroneMobile,Connected Car,NomNom Tech,4.0 out of 5 stars,Follow this to get it working!,"Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2019","Took forever for me to figure out but finally works. First make sure you have a pin set on the drone mobile website. Second make sure you car has a sinple name. I have a Nissan Juke so in the drone app the car was named “Jukey”. Well alexa doesnt like that name and it never worked. Finally changed the nane to simply “Car” and i said “Alexa, ask drone mobile to start CAR” alexa will ask for your pin, you tell her the pin, wait 5 seconds and done!"

Drone just thought it sounded good.","Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2020","So part of the reason why i opted for a remote start with Drone App is because I rely on Alexa frequently for many things throughout my day. I imagined this beautiful world where I could be shaving and simply tell Alexa to start my car on a cold Ohio morning. So the most important reason for me to use the Drone App was for the Alexa interface. The reality? Complete flop. Every time Ive asked to have any command accomplished from Drone, Alexa tells me that she doesnt know basically what the hell Im saying because there is no such car. she then LISTS my car whose name is strangely my Drone App profile name. When i ask her to, lets say, unlock (Profile Name) thinking that must be the trick, Alexa responds with the same information about not recognizing the car but i can choose from this list blah blah blah.  How hard is it to send a simple command to my very expensive remote starter with paid Drone App subscription? Apparently much more difficult then telling Alexa, while driving, to turn on my $10 smart bulb in my living room. what gives? this needs addressed hopefully before the time comes to renew my subscription. I'll just use the remote control if the Alexa feature is a bust and dust the Drone App. Sorry but not a good first impression of cutting edge consumer electronics. ugh!"

I had a friend added to my account, who also had a Drone Mobile product, so this friend could also unlock my truck on his phone app. A few months into the subscription I was told the current unit in my truck was now out of date and I would need to purchase and install a new unit for a ""discounted price"" of $29.99. After several conversations with Drone mobile representatives, once being hung up on, and approximately 30 minutes for each call before I could speak with a representative, a manager finally agreed to send me a free updated unit to have installed in my truck. After the new unit was installed it would not work. When I again called Drone Mobile I was told my account had been deleted and my friend was the only authorized user for MY ACCOUNT that I activated and paid for with MY credit card. After this mess was fixed I learned that my 2yrs subscription was cancelled. I had to argue and show proof that I purchased a 2 yrs subscription. I was so aggravated I canceled my subscription and requested a refund that I am still waiting for 1 month later."

If you can remote start your car with your phone on the Drone App, you can set it up with Alexa. First / set a PIN on your account on the Drone Mobile site. Not in the app. Second / give your car a clear and simple name. Good: The van, my car, red truck. Bad: old Bessie, Jonah’s Jalopy, Melvin’s Benz. Ok, now this is a Skill. Alexa cannot start your car. She has to ask Drone Mobile to do it. So the phrase is “Alexa, ask Drone Mobile to start The Van” and she asks for your PIN, then you reply and say it slowly “one … five… three … two”.  Good luck."

It's great when it works but the unit needs to be reset every 6-10 weeks. This entails submitting a support ticket via their website. They provide a video that says you can reset the unit via a sequence of button pushing in the car but I never got that to work. The app is ok but would be better if they included a RESET button in it. I'm going to have this unit pulled and replaced by another product. Overall disappointing.

B071Z28K7T,DroneMobile,Connected Car,Steve rohde,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product!! (BUT READ THIS BEFORE BUYING),"Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2019","I did no purchase from here but this review is for informational purposes. This product is a great ADD ON. That is what the drone is. It IS NOT an auto start. It is an add on for Compustar auto starts. It will not start you car unless u have a compustar auto start. All it is is an interface between itself and the auto start itself. You have to put in the auto start too. If not then all it will do is lock and unlock the doors. I bought mine and had it installed locally. For a final cost of $499. That was the auto start, drone and installation. I paid fee for three years for $130. It works great! Yes telling Alexa or Siri to start is is not and option yet, but locking and unlocking door works ok at best. That should not be a deal breaker. The only reason I bought it is because factory starters suck! And don’t have a very long range, so being able to start from unlimited range is well worth the fee to use it. Also you can add key fobs to is for 100 because an antenna must be installed. I chose not to have it done yet but probably will at some point. Finally I don’t think the price is out of line for being able to start your car from basically anywhere. One last time the drone is not an auto start it is a add on to the auto start. It’s all there on the website. Or do what I did and go the a retailer and ask some questions. Besides I would be a little skeptical if the whole thing was only 100 bucks."

Luckily, they updated that in the last upgrade to their system, but now I can’t use my new password, which is very secure, to log into this stupid skill! Lazy implementation, if you ask me. I know how to run software implementations and it really bugs me that they would let such a show stopping bug into their system.

To save the most amount of money go with the five year premium plan it is roughly $370 but if you do the math it by far saves you money with a lot of features. Remember you have to do this within the first 30 days. Viper just doesn’t have the features of drone Mobile. One of the number one things I was looking for is Alexa start capabilities. Step one access your DroneMobile account on a computer and in dashboard set up a pin you can make it super simple as little as three digits. Then enable the skill and login on your Alexa app. Name your vehicle on the drone app “car” “truck” ,”Van”...etc . Then simply tell Alexa “ask Drone mobile to start my “blank”. Unrelated to Alexa but you can also use Siri to only lock and unlock your doors. simply say hey Siri lock my car, Siri will then ask you to confirm, you must say “yes”"

B079TYL5CZ,myCadillac,Connected Car,Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Works, Alexa isnt so smart though","Reviewed in the United States on December 21, 2021",All the folks crying about the verbal pin is dumb. Dont use the show off feature around people? Use the app when around ppl you dont trust. Proper use is at home(where most alexa devices are ..geniuses). Maybe use a hands free headset while walking with groceries. This feature is meant for convience not reliability. You silver spoon fed babies need to find another hobby other than collectively complaining about a gift of a feature...smh my real complaint is alexa doesnt always know who cadillac is and sends me to google. The invocations should be shorter and more precise.

The only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that you are asked for your PIN before Alexa will send commands to the car. This is an important security feature but it slows down the experience to the point where I'd rather just find my key fob and start the car.

Each command worked flawlessly.  I do not envision a need to use this all the time but I was impressed and would use it under extreme weather conditions to pre-heat or pre-cool the vehicle."

B079TYTNKJ,myBuick,Connected Car,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Having Problems Linking myBuick skill?,"Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2021","I have been in the same boat as many of you with the myBuick skill.  I have had no problems getting things set up except for the myBuick skill.  Everytime I would sign in using my username and password I would get a message that said input error.  This was very frustrating because I have had no problems logging into the my buick app or onstar.  So, I contacted Alexa technical support several times with them all telling me to disable and enable the skill.  This did not work so I stopped trying.  Then a few days later, a light bulb went off and I decided to contact Onstar.  I am so glad I did because they fixed my problem in less than a minute.  My issue was my email was spelled incorrectly through onstar.  So, if you are getting the input error message, it is probably because your email might be wrong through onstar.  Give them a call, you will be glad you did!!  Skill works great!!!"

Only thing to note is you have to get the verbiage correct for it to work seamlessly. Saying “Alexa ask Lexus to...” does the trick.I actually find that starting the car with Alexa is much quicker than using the app itself (which speaks volumes about how terrible the Lexus app is). I noticed several reviews about not getting a confirmation of start. Here’s a trick for getting them. Enable confirmed start notifications in the Lexus app. Then when Alexa successfully starts your vehicle, you’ll get a notification on your phone confirming the start."

The support technician said that my Enform account had been corrupted and he reset it . I received an email with a link to reset my password and that solved the whole problem.

The skill linked just fine, and I can't say the same for other link-type skills, so 1 star. I like the intent of this app, so another star.  The skill behaved as instructed, so the 3rd star but thats where it ends.  The Skill needs real Settings desperately.  Alexa frustrates me beyond belief, she won't respond unless I refer to my car/SUV as the “black Genesis GV80”.  I am the only driver in my household and should be able to name the vehicle what I want, then refer to it accordingly.  Further, the Genesis app requires a PIN to perform certain actions, great security. But in my secure home, if the vehicle is connected to the same wifi signal as Alexa, I should NOT be forced to provide my PIN to perform an action.  Argh, get real Settings, not just Link your app."

Also about 30% of the time, it doesn't do what I ask, but I get a message from Genesis itself in my email, so I suspect that's not a problem with this skill, but rather, with the upstream Genesis service that connects to the modem.I'm not sure how this Alexa skill ""solves"" any ""problem"" I have--I used it once to make sure car was locked, but I could have just as easily walked to the window and pressed the bottom, or used the Android app."

The indicator for success is when she ask for my pin before then saying she's having trouble. Initially, once setup was complete she never asked for my pin before stating having trouble and therefore not successful. After a half hour or so she began asking for my pin followed by a statement of having trouble yet she starts the car. I suppose it took a short delay to update and link to the Genesis system to begin asking for my pin.  I'm not sure why she states having trouble although the car starts successfully.

It works half the time at best. I have not yet been able to confirm a service appointment through blue link without calling tech support. They were less than helpful. Requiring two return phoned calls just to confirm an oil change. The agent was confused and it sounded as if their computer system worked half the time as well. Who is in charge of this part of Hyundai? Hyundai should be evaluating their skills for continued employment. And a complete overhaul of the Genesis connected car services. As Genesis/Blue link seem to have more failures than successes. Very disappointed Hyundai.

The car has only been out year or so when Hyundai decides to split off and have Genesis as  a separate brand . So those of us who dropped 40 grand plus on this we are just a casualty of them doing business . We don't get any of the perks the 2017 get . And we cant use this skill to start or do any of the functions to our car. Please note it will work but Alexa , even though it keeps saying its having trouble accessing my Geneis. Just for giggles  I opened the Blue Link skill and it doesnt have that problem . Hyundai /Genesis just lost  one of there loyal customers. I have owned a Hyundai vechicle starting with  2003 every 2 years I sell it and buy a different one . WHAT A JOKE THEY HAVE TURNED OUT TO BE . I wish them the best of luck  they will need it."

B07BQG1SQB,Lincoln Way,Connected Car,Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Awful experience!,"Reviewed in the United States on October 10, 2021","I have a brand new beautiful Lincoln nautilus (2021).  I was an hour away from home for a doctors appointment and had a flat tire.  I thought,”ok, I’m going to learn about my Lincoln way”.  I opened the app only to see a portion of the home page,  couldn’t get it to full view,  couldn’t use it.  It was frozen.  ( My other apps were just fine).  I called the local Ford/Lincoln dealer who told me to call the person I bought my car from.  I did,  And she said she would get me the number, meanwhile she sent me a screen shot of the Lincoln way app showing me where the “24/7” was located.  I guess she missed the part that I could only see a quarter of my page and it was frozen!  I called the Lincoln way number,  And the gentleman spoke very broken English,  and there was an awful echo of everything I said reverberating back to me.  It took a while for me to slowly get vin number, location,….to him.  He wanted the address,  And I told him over and over I was in a grocery store parking lot and gave the street and cross street and what was across the street,  but I didn’t have an address.  After a while,  he said I was set,  and would dispatch someone to change my tire.  I received a text a few minutes later from Lincoln with a gps type map to confirm my location.  I did.  A few minutes later I received a text saying someone was dispatched and eta was 45-60 min.  ( I took this time to figure out car-play).  An hour later I received a text asking if I was taken care of…I responded “no”.  I received a text saying they would follow up.  I received a text saying new eta was 30 min.  45 min later I received a text with the name of who they had dispatched and asked if I had been taken care of.  I said “no”.  I called the tire/tow company myself and asked how long it would be,  and I was told the request had been cancelled by Lincoln way.  At this point,  I was hot, tired, unhappy and frustrated.  After new ETA’s several times,  I called AAA , (which my Lincoln dealer had told me I should cancel, because I now have wonderful Lincoln way 24/7 service. ).FYI…AAA was there in 15 min.  Only to find THERE IS NO SPARE TIRE!  so,  we had to dispatch a tow, To shorten this,  Over a period of 6 hours,  yes, 6 hours,  I had 17 texts from Lincoln way.  I talked to them on the phone 3 times.  I talked with the tire/tow people 3 times.  No one ever showed up!  Right, I said “no one ever showed up”!AAA ( who gave an ETA of 30 min and showed up in 15, found I had no tire, and then dispatched a tow for me. The tow ETA was 45 min, and they were there in 35,  towed me to a dealer,  who put on a new tire.WILL BE MAKING SURE EVERYONE KNOWS ABOUT THIS AWFUL SERVICE."

B07BQG1SQB,Lincoln Way,Connected Car,Boston626,2.0 out of 5 stars,Inconsistent Results,"Reviewed in the United States on January 26, 2019","Have only been using for a week with my 17 MKZ and starting the car from inside my house with an echo has worked consistently. However, 90% of the time if I try and use Alexa inside the car it's comes back saying ""Sorry, I’m having trouble understanding you right now. Please try a little later”. With an actual Echo device this message typically means it has lost WiFi connection, so I've endured my phone does have 4G signal but still no luck. Am hopeful an update will solve.Also it'd be nice if Lincoln+Alexa in the car could pull music from Spotify like an Echo does in my house as the default music service. Not sure if this is simply a feature that could be added, or if it's a licensing thing."

B07BQG1SQB,Lincoln Way,Connected Car,Kita,1.0 out of 5 stars,VERY BAD EXPERIENCE,"Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2021","Purchased a Brand new 2020 Lincoln Aviator, had for about 4 months. Tried to remote start last night and it wouldn't work. So I tried to manually start it and still wouldn't work. The door wouldn't shut, the lights wouldn't come on or the car. Not to mention it was freezing outside.Called ""Lincoln My Way"" and the representative was nice but completely inexperienced. Gave me the incorrect directions and, of course, nothing worked. So he transferred me and I another rep to arrange towing my car.Well, he was even worst. He kept asking me the same questions about 20 different ways. So if I tell you the car won't start then why are you asking me to turn the car on and put it in neutral. He just made matters worst. Finally got my tow setup and that was the end of that, so I thought.So I had it towed to the local Oxmoor Lincoln. First, the website said the service department was  open on Sunday. Secondly, I called to get a loaner, per my warranty and the worthless extended warranty, and the Sales Manager tells me I have to wait till Monday because the Service Dept is closed. Mind you I have to work, with no damn car to drive in!!!I was beyond frustrated. First, that a brand expensive new car is a piece of junk!!! Then the representatives was not even a 2 star rating and the local dealership is a joke. I had a Chevy and my sales guy always made sure I had a loaner car. We didn't have to go through service and they brought it to you or picked you up. I pay all this money for NOTHING!!!! I will never buy another Lincoln EVER!!!"

But you have to say a very specific phrase “Alexa, ask Acura to start my car”, and then she talks back to you about making sure it’s in a certain locaiton, blah blah blah, and then you have to enter a passcode - and it’s just kind of obnoxious. Like just start my flipping car already, i dont want to have a 3minute discussion about it... cuz at that point the app is just faster. Hopefully they improve it."

While its still kinda useful if your hands are full, it is honestly no faster than the app. There are many skills here (like simplysafe) where the commands and dialogue included just take up SOOO much time. Ive managed to figure out how to cut down on the command phrase by using routines and the custom option to just be able to say “start car” but this doesnt help with Alexa’s response being so long.i remember when all these smart devices started to get popular and i always thought people looked And sounded so silly talking yo robots. i still feel this way. i didnt buy this device so that i can talk to robots for fun. i bought it so that i can use it as a quick and efficient vocal button to trigger things around the house.

B0744DQGMD,Bouncie,Connected Car,Stellagirl,5.0 out of 5 stars,Empowers my teen to drive safely,"Reviewed in the United States on February 3, 2018","Very easy to install, and the app is super intuitive and colorful.I bought this for my 18 year old son. He's had it for a couple of days and both he and I like it a lot. At first, he was very upset that I would propose putting a device in his truck. But I followed the advice on Bouncie's website for how to talk to my teen, and it worked. Basically, they recommend being transparent about the product, and emphasizing 'yes, I trust you that's why I helped you get a car, and I also want to keep you safe.' He installed it himself and took his truck for a drive.  When he returned, we looked at the map together, and discussed speed at various points on his outing. He actually likes the app. The app lets him decide when he wants to get alerts, such as when speed exceeds 70 or after hard braking. He likes the idea of getting feedback from the app on his driving.The big win is this: our discussions about his driving are now data-driven.  He used to interpret my comments as nagging; now I can point to the app and let the data do the talking. So the device is turning out to be a way of empowering him to take responsibility for safe driving. I'm happily surprised by that!"

They was only good for GPS location only.  Then I heard of hum from Verizon's that has GPS and Reads Vehicle status code. after spending a week talking to tech. support, it was determined that the hum device was dead on arrival. After having it exchanged, the next one was half working so I returned it. I seen the bouncie on Amazon.  not much review informations on it. but this one hits the spot. GPS is right on where the vehicle is parked. trip history is synced with the road map not off to the side or straight lines. many features available to use if you has a young or new driver in the household. service is at this time of writing $8/monthAs for this app. it works perfect for me."

I RECEIVED AN EMAIL AND I WAS ABLE TO COMPLETE THE SETUP PROCESS. MY GARMIN SPEAK PLUS WITH ALEXA IS NOW FULLY SETUP AND FULLY FUNCTIONAL AGAIN.Just to be clear about this issue. The problem isn't with the Garmin Speak Plus or your phone. The issue is a compatibility one between the Alexa Garmin skill and the Garmin Speak Plus. I spoke with Garmin and they confirmed. They told me they are working to fix the compatibility issue with the Alexa Garmin skill as they are the developer of the skill.  It's just a waiting game. They informed me that this issue has been escalated. The only thing I can do now is wait for the fix and an email from them. I told them that they have rendered all Garmin Speak Plus with Alexa useless and that they are still available for purchase. This is so wrong.

B075TRB4V5,Garmin,Connected Car,Chris Cramer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The basics are there, and I'm looking forward to seeing how it matures","Reviewed in the United States on January 26, 2018","The Garmin Speak is an awesome idea.  I love having Alexa in my car to be able to control my Smart Home!  However, the audio doesn't work for me.  If I connect it to Bluetooth, I have to set my car stereo source to Bluetooth and I can't listen to the radio or the satellite radio.  I've decided to just use the Speak's speaker; however at times, to be able to listen to it at reasonable levels, my phone requires me to accept a warning that listening at high volumes for long periods of time can damage my hearing.I have also had issues with the phone connecting to the Speak.  I have had to restart my phone, let it connect to Bluetooth, log into the phone, open the Speak app, and let it connect multiple times.  However, other times, it immediately connects automatically.I also own the Garmin DriveLuxe 50 GPS.  I miss the large screen with the Speak.  Right now, I have both the Speak and the DriveLuxe 50 installed in my car.  The GPS functionality of the DriveLuxe far exceeds the Speak, but it is convenient to be able to say, ""Alexa, ask Garmin to navigate to Best Buy"" and ""Alexa, what are the business hours for x?  I think I'll end up keeping both devices for different reasons.  The DriveLuxe is awesome as a GPS.  The Speak is awesome as Alexa and a backup GPS.  (I love being able to tell Alexa to ""Set the thermostat to 74"" on my way home from work!)I foresee many improvements, tweaks, and new skills to be added on a quick pace with this device.  I'm looking forward to watching the technology mature, but I hope the device that I have bought won't be obsolete too quickly as the resource demands increase.Ideally, I think that Garmin should integrate Alexa into their full GPS devices.  Alexa on my DriveLuxe would be perfect!"

For example, it takes me to the house BEHIND my house (on a perpendicular street) whenever I navigate home.  The positive is, Garmin is receptive to fixing mapping errors, so I let them know.On the other hand, I love what it PROMISES to do... that is, hands-free navigation.  When it works, it's awesome.  And I love being able to chat up Alexa on the road, so we can continue our argument where we left off at home."

The sound will be as good as the speakers you have in the car. Is able to do navigating and play music at the same time which is great. Sometimes you have to raise your voice above the level of the music to get Alexa's attention. I put it up and to the right of the rearview mirror and it makes for a clean installation without wire clutter.  Directions are clear and work fine.  If you already know how to pair devices, etc. then it is a breeze.  If you are tech challenged then get someone to do a neat installation and pair your device.  Has a hard time learning ""home"", but that may just be how I am addressing Alexa.  You have to say, Alexa ask Garmin to...  Overall pleased with the purchase."

B075435C1Y,Mercedes me,Connected Car,Amazon_CustomerCAN,2.0 out of 5 stars,Mercedes Me Connect app - remote start limitations,"Reviewed in the United States on December 13, 2018","The remote start app only works about 50% of the time, the other 50% it gives an error message ""An error occurred when sending the request to the vehicle. Please try again later"".The remote start won't work if you have less than 30% fuel, which is between 150-170 kms.The remote start will only work twice before you have to physically start the vehicle. This would primarily be an issue for people who live where the winters are very very cold.Having a reliable remote starter was the main reason I chose Mercedes over other models. If I had known the remote starter was unreliable and had these limitations, I would have selected another brand."
B075435C1Y,Mercedes me,Connected Car,Sebastian Merino,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works great, even though it says it doesn't.","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2018","This skill works great. I can start my car while I'm getting ready for work without having to take out my phone to use the app and I can lock my car if I forget to. For the people having issues with the ""trouble accessing Mercedes Me"" response, it is most likely because you have a 2018 or older car that is supposed to use the original Mercedes Me, as this skill is optimized for 2019 and newer (and some 2018 C and GLE-Class) which gives you all the additional functionality shown in the description, like how much gas you have left or your range. If you have a car that uses the older MM app, it still works. It will still always respond ""trouble accessing MB"" but the command still goes through and my car starts every time. Hope this helps some people having issues with this app."

Enable ""Interface to Third-Party Providers"".  I spent hours researching this and no one at Mercedes was able to tell me this is the fix.  My Mercedes reps said the Me Connect was not compatible with Alexa.  I knew there was no way the engineers in the Fatherland would allow that to happen.

B075435C1Y,Mercedes me,Connected Car,Peyman f.,1.0 out of 5 stars,%100 Disaster experience of Mercedes  S 550e,"Reviewed in the United States on April 8, 2020","%100 disaster please stay away from Mercedes as my Experience from my S550 has been awful. I have 2017 S550e. My kids they do not like to get a ride inside of my car because of their bad Experience and they have safer feeling with my wife’s car which is a cheaper 3 series BMW . From the beginning of my lease i have had lots of issues and i still have them . Let me get started with The transmission which does automatic downshift by itself and it has happened couple of time on freeways with higher speeds and on street . It Seems like your suddenly pushing the break pedal and the roar of the engine is coming inside and scaring you and other passengers like my kids . I report this incident a couple of times to this dealers , W.I.simonson , calabasas and Encino mercedes benz branches of Los Angeles area and they say let’s go on a test drive and show us what the issue is .how can I show them if this happens approximately one time per month the last time in Encino branch the person who test my car was Mr Charles and during the ride he told me we have to keep your car for a couple of days and I complained about how i pay approximately $1,500 monthly to Mercedes and I even did pay $10,000 down payment to get my payment lowered and I drive really normal. He then denied to keep the car and told me seems like you don’t like the car and the car doesn’t show any problem and he talked about this to my service advisor Mr kevin Malone and they refuse any claim towards my car . It was about safety and let me explain about lots more issues . The sound system is good brand but the car does not match with iPhone 10 . I took my cars couple of times and I explained to them how I cannot connect my phone to the car ( not with Bluetooth and not with wire car's speakers will not connect to any app like Facebook videos even your gallery video's but sometimes is working with Youtube and sometimes not ) and they told me go to Apple Store and Which I did . Apple store then told me that this is a Mercedes problem and I believe them, because I had a 2013 E Class Mercedes and I never had any issues with that needless to say when they give you a loaner car all those cars work perfectly even though they are the less expensive models such as C class or GLA but they connect to my phone perfectly and I explain it to them and the Encino , Calabasa and W.I.Simonson branches told me they are not able to do anything about it because the car has an older system(my car is 2017) I told them that I never had any problems with the system of my old E class which was a 2013 Mercedes but they still refused it also Calabasas dealer bring one 2018 S class and they tried but it had the same issue as my car . The back up camera has issue and sometimes it showing your monitor half black and the other half is an unknown place. Sit belt of the passenger locked one time and my son was stuck in the seat and after turning the car off and on 2 times the car released the seatbelt . The first month of my lease I got 2 flat tires and when I get to tire shop ( because I didn’t buy the tire protection plan ) The person showed me the tire and from the inside they were ripped and there was a big tear from inside the tire but outside had no damage or scratch . I definitely will not buy a 3rd Mercedes and I am considering to buy better quality car like a Tesla and not a car that's just popular for the name of its brand such as Mercedes with horrible quality ,and offensive customer service and waste of peoples money. I have all the issues documented by photo and video and witnesses and I love to show to who ever that would like to know. I am right and here is my car information for you to know that i’m not from another car companies."

However in order for this to work you need to make sure that you set up a couple things first.First I recommend visiting the BMW connected website to make sure that your vehicle is compatible with BMW connected apps.After doing this navigate to your device specific application store and download the BMW connected app for North America.Following the downloaded the app open it up and you log in and connected to your vehicle.**NOTE:  if you things that I've noticed as I own a couple BMWs the BMW connected feature needs to be activated if you just purchased your car it usually takes 24 to 48 hours. If you're running into issues using the BMW connected app features you can always hit the SOS button in the car or call the bmw customer service they are super helpful. I also recommend going online to the BMW connected website to ensure that your profile is set up correctly. While at the website check to see if your BMW is capable of using BMW connected features. Beginning around January of 2017, for 2013 BMW models and earlier, BMW disconnected the BMWConnected feature as these have a 3G/2G SIM card these cars use the CIC and CCC iDrive interfaces.Once you've downloaded the app, logged in, and connected to your vehicle. Pay attention to the features available for your model.Now link the  the alexa skill by using the in skill prompts .Following this use the correct commands to activate the skill. And you should be good to go.Overall the skill it's been really good has help me lock my car when I forgot to lock it. As always the skills are always getting better so give it a try."

There are way too many words involved.Silently failing if the doors aren't locked is soo frustrating.  Why don't you just automatically lock it? I'm not sure what the intended use case is but this is so slow and cumbersome that it's basically unusable outside of a party trick.I can understand legal issues and kid safety around requiring a pin every time you send a command and require it be locked before remote starting but at least let this be options that we can override.If we could at least setup shortcut commands that would make this drasticlly better"

B01M9H2JCK,Hyundai Blue Link,Connected Car,Afterbyrner,3.0 out of 5 stars,"A great thought, slow to execute, misses a lot of commands","Reviewed in the United States on December 20, 2016","I think many reviewers have made the mistake of complaining about Blue Link and/or the pricing offered by Hyundai when rating this skill.  This is a review of the actual Alexa skill, separate from what Hyundai may or may not charge.First, this is a great start.  Hyundai is one of the only car companies offering this kind of flexibility so I have to give them credit for being at the cutting edge of blending virtual assistants for the home with cars.  This skill comes in handy from time to time and it definitely gives you that ""wow I'm in the future"" feeling when you simply ask your virtual assistant to start your car while you're still pulling your pants on.  I also have to say that many other companies can learn from this skill, as it's one of the only ones I've used that allows me to issue two commands at once (ie ""Start my Sonata and set the heat to 72 degrees), or just one command (ie ""Start my Sonata"").In practice, though, I've found that more often than not it's easier to just unlock my phone and start the car with the Blue Link app.  The problem here is that issuing the ""Ask blue link to start my sonata..."" command virtually never works.  It's not just me, everyone in the house has struggled with it.  The only consistent way I can get it to work is to ask Alexa to open Blue Link, listen to the lengthy ""welcome to blue link"" schpeal and then say ""Start my Sonata...""  And if that command fails, I still have to listen to yet another lengthy blurb about incorrect commands before trying again.  It would actually be quicker to run outside and just start the car.Speaking of speed, this is sloooooooooowwwww.  I can issue the command to start the car, walk casually downstairs, put my shoes and coat on, wait for the garage door to open and walk out to the driveway before the car starts.  That's not an exaggeration, that's my daily routine.  A major part of this is that Blue Link itself is maddeningly slow, but relaying it through Alexa adds more time to the already slow process.Overall, the skill itself is a great step in the right direction, but it needs to do better at recognizing commands, and Hyundai needs to speed up the process."
B01M9H2JCK,Hyundai Blue Link,Connected Car,Cody J.,2.0 out of 5 stars,kinda bad,"Reviewed in the United States on July 2, 2019","i mean it does start my car... most of the time; however, a good portion of that time, it reports an error, but still starts the car ( so it’s a fun guessing game right). Also, having to yell my pin out across my house makes it pointless; I mean, it’s like if you needed to tell the cashier at the store your credit pin verbally, it’d make it useless. Overall that freaking pin is pointless anyway., so please get rid of it!"
B01M9H2JCK,Hyundai Blue Link,Connected Car,Brett Smith,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The App is nice, the execution is crap","Reviewed in the United States on March 27, 2019","BlueLink looks great on the surface and provides a lot of convenient options.  The app is well designed and easy to learn.  Unfortunately, BlueLink itself is just this side of garbage.  The only way to remote start your Hyundai is through the app.  It would be fine if the car started with 10 or 15 seconds of sending the command but real world times are closer to 2 to 3 minutes.  So if you want to send any command to your car (lock, unlock, start, etc.) then you'd better plan ahead.  This is not an exaggeration.  I have had commands to start the vehicle take longer than 4 minutes before my 2019 Santa Fe actually starts.  That of course depends on whether the command actually works.  I would guess that sending a smart command through the app is successful 60-70% of the time so expect that you should get an error message 2-3 minutes later saying the command did not succeed about a third of the time.  How about this setup?  You cannot remote start the vehicle unless the doors are locked.  I like the idea from a security standpoint, but why doesn't the app just build in the lock command as part of the remote start process?Here is a real world scenario of what really can happen about a 3rd of the time:10:45am: Send command for remote start10:48am: Receive a message on your phone that it failed to start because the doors are unlocked10:49am: Send command to lock the doors10:51am: Receive confirmation that doors are now locked10:52am: Send command to remote start10:54am: Receive message that remote start failed (no reason given)10:55am: Resend command to remote start vehicle10:58am: Vehicle finally startsThis is NOT an exaggeration. This is the kind of timetable that happens about 1/4 of the time.  13 minutes just to get the car to start.  Now add 10 minutes for it to warm up.  It took 23 minutes and 4 commands just to get the vehicle ready to go.  Plan accordingly, heaven forbid you don't have half an hour to plan to start your car.The non-vehice command related stuff is decent.  It takes a good minute or so to get status updates and reports but that is almost acceptable (hence the 2 stars instead of 1) and there is a lot of stuff you can do with it.  I suspect BlueLink has some network problems outside of the app itself.  If you're a migrator from something like OnStar you will be very frustrated with the delays."

I am 27 years old and more than capable of figuring out how to set up an app. I found the description a little confusing of the different packages Blue Link offers. I enrolled in all 3 (trial period). My car isn't compatible with the remote start feature, ok fair enough. I cannot for the life of me get the remote lock/unlock features working. It loads/buffers and never actually works, or it says 'incorrect pin' which I can assure you isn't the case. Honestly, maybe the emergency services aren't bad but I set it up for other reasons too. I set it up to notify me if the vehicle was in a crash and to get the monthly service emails, so far the user experience is complete TRASH, literally nothing on the app/website works for me.

The error message in the app states: ""Remote Stop for your vehicle cannot be processed. Remote Stop can only be used during Remote Start session. [HT_539]."" If I try to stop it through the skill, Alexa tells me: ""Hmm. A remote stop request cannot be processed since your previous remote start process has already concluded.""

B01M9H2JCK,Hyundai Blue Link,Connected Car,Witczek,1.0 out of 5 stars,Trash,"Reviewed in the United States on November 13, 2021","Had Bluelink for the trial period when I first bought my Sonata, it was OK. it worked for most of the time, although there was a couple times the remote start from the app failed, or the diagnostics took a couple days to update, not a biggie.Once summer hit, my trial ended and I really didn't need to remote start my car anymore.Earlier this week, I decided to reactivate it. I purchased Connected Care+Remote. I updated my App all should be good right?It says it could be up to 24 hours before my account is updated, no worries. They charged my card. 4 days later, when I try to Lock/Unlock or remote start my car, I get a pop up saying I need the more expensive Connected Care + Remote + Guidance.I combed through the website looking for this ""small print""... (Which can't be found by the way)The subscription page breaks down what each one will get you. Guidance just included navigation, which I don't need and am not going to pay and additional $10 a month for.On the website, on my account and subscription page it literally states to Lock/Unlock and remote start, you only need the ""Remote"" (+Connected Care, because that is kind of an automatic).But the app says I need the top package that includes the navigation? No thanks.When I try to see my diagnostics from the App (Connected Care) the same pop up appears telling me I need Connected Care + Remote + Guidance... yet your car health is the point of the Connected Care... ?So I say fine, I will log on from my computer, it shows my subscription, renewal date, last payment, subscription level, etc. But when I try to do any of the remote features, it says ""Error"". When I try to do the Connected care features, it updates from before when I had the free trial.They have a ""Virtual Assistant"" which is trash. Forget about getting a live human being on the phone, I've tried for two days. You go through their automated system which states if you want to talk to a rep stay on the line. But that never happens. Either the line goes dead or you get automatically rerouted to ""Genesis Protection Plan"" and asks if you are a ""CPO or Dealer"" ( I pressed both on different calls since I wasn't going anywhere) Still nothing. I got to one part that tells me to enter a claim #.It is literally IMPOSSIBLE to talk to a human being.I am getting a after market remote start on my car, Merry Christmas to me.I would not recommend BlueLink to anyone. Even if it works great, once you have an issue, there is no avenue to get it corrected."

With my ford, I have a routine every night send a lock command. It happens automatically. With Hyundai Blue Link you have to say a code for it to go through. Why? I can understand if you are starting the car or unlocking the car, but why when locking?****************************************************************Had fun getting the actual car registered with Blue Link. From the dealer not putting the car under the right email, to the modem not activating.Now we have it working from the app, although there is about a 30 second to 1 minute delay.However, now that I have it connected with Alexa, I have watched as the Show app crashes when asking it to unlock the doors, and a dot continually circling until, I assume, the Blue Link app crashes. Using the Alexa app on the phone for a Blue Link request causes it to lock up on the request page. So basically it is worthless of an Alexa Skill.Reading other reviews, I am sure I would not be a fan of saying the PIN code out loud. They should really make the API show up as a device or scene. That way it is native to Alexa and if shows up as lock you can give it a personal PIN."

You can’t buy just that feature, rather you have to purchase two levels of money grabbing.  I signed up on the 21st of the month and by the 30th was still unable to activate the service.  I spent time on the phone with polite people who apologized profusely and talked to engineers while writing a ticket to seek help. The next date frame for response from so-called engineers is from the 3rd through the 9th of the upcoming month.  Don’t fall for this.

I was shopping for remote start as I live in Boise Idaho and temps get down -1.  Not until after the purchase they told me “Oh the remote start is in an app”.  I have tried this app for 6mths and needed to upgrade my iPhone and go to unlimited data. This still did not help.  I have to keep the app open, and iPhone in hand whether coming out of a store or in my house. It takes 2 mins to circle through phone carrier then to the Bluelink server and then to car.  I Even had the dealer service tech go through it with me three times standing by the car in the facility with Wi-Fi internet connection.  Still took over 2 mins.  I travel in mountain areas with no cell coverage so the bluelink app is worthless.  Please Hyundai put the he remote start back on the key fob. I WILL not be paying for this subscription when trail time expires. Oh I also got an email stating Hyundai cars it’s bluelink over a certain number of years will not be supported any longer.Buyer beware.  This Bluelink is awful.Linda"

Both 2020 models.  Obviously both are equipped with Blue Link.  Blue Link has not worked on either vehicle from the day we got them.  Neither of us are able to use any of the functions.  The remote start would be especially useful as we live in Colorado and both work nights.  We have been in contact with Hyundai customer service who referred us to Blue Link customer service.  We both had ""tickets"" started for them to look into this problem.  Blue Link and their engineers insist that we do not have adequate service to use these functions.  This is after we have provided ample documentation to prove that we do have more than enough service to use these functions.  We are extremely dissatisfied with Hyundai and Blue Link for their lack of wanting to make this issue right.  We took our vehicles to our local Hyundai service center and they said that they have had to replace many radios due to this issue.  Apparently the radio is where the ""brain"" of  Blue Link is.  But for some reason Blue Link is refusing to do this for us.  The Blue Link feature is one of the features we were looking forward to having on our vehicles.  Utterly disappointed.  We will probably have to have remote starts installed on our vehicles out of our own pockets because Hyundai Blue Link engineers apparently don't care."

When it comes time to renew and actually pay for it, I would prefer being REIMBURSED for the supposed EXTRA, ""free"" 3 years of this GIFTY-TYPE feature that helped sell me this car.  Oooooh!  Look what we're giving you for FREE!!!!  I'd like to be reimbursed for being deceived, disappointed and disillusioned. For every time I send a command that works, such as lock the doors from inside the house because I forgot, I get an AVERAGE of 5-10 error messages telling me that ""this service is not available at this time; try again later.""  How MUCH later?  I've tried for an HOUR to start my car because it's cold out there and I'm old in here.  Why is it unavailable MOST OF THE TIME?  There is absolutely NO WAY I would ever 'renew' this feature and throw money away on it.  It's all but useless.  Blue Link and Hyundai need to put their heads together and figure out how to fix this extremely disappointing ""feature"".  It stinks.  If I depended on this feature to actually work, I'd be late for church, doctor appointments. picking up my grandson from school, etc., etc., etc.  It is 99% undependable.

Yay! 2016 SONATA,"Reviewed in the United States on September 28, 2017","I had the same trouble as everyon else. I kept getting the ""disable/enable message too"" so I sent Amazon an email. They replied to call it in. I did and I'm glad bc the issue was simple. I have a bluelink subscription, I set everything up in the Alexa app and it didn't work. I am also apart of a amazon household account and my husband is the primary member. So his profile is on Alexa first. All I had to do was tell Alexa ""switch profiles"" or you can say your name+profile. Once on my profile I say ""Alexza tell bluelink to start my sonata"" she asks for my PIN I tell her and she sends the request. VERY EASY! However if you're not under the right profile she'll do nothing because the skill needs to be enabled on the other members app/phone. Hope this helps!"

B01M9H2JCK,Hyundai Blue Link,Connected Car,Barry Hughes,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works brilliantly - *if* and only *if* your Hyundai has the right hardware,"Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2016",Good Lord people.  Starting with the 2015 Sonata/Genesis Hyundai introduced AVN 4.0/4.5 (do a search) which includes additional h/w supported functionality over their earlier nav/media systems.  It's that functionality that allows newer cars to be used with Alexa.  There will never be an update for older cars as the changes are h/w not s/w.  So either buy a newer Hyundai or don't buy an Echo if its primary purpose would be to control your car. I traded a 2014 Elantra GT for a 2016 specifically for the updated Nav capabilities which also include Android Auto and Apple Car Play.  For the record owners of older Hyundais won't be getting those features either for the same reason they can't use Alexa.  It's the h/w.

B01M9H2JCK,Hyundai Blue Link,Connected Car,Jayde Jones,1.0 out of 5 stars,Expected way more-very disappointed,"Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2021","I purchased a 2020 Hyundai Santa Fe a month and a half ago which came enabled with Bluelink. I was very excited about this service for a few reasons 1. I live in Montana and our average temperature this last week was around -25 F, the idea that I was going to be able to remote start my vehicle was a very attractive feature. 2. The idea that I would also be able to diagnose issues with my vehicle was also a very enticing feature. The unfortunate part is that those ideas have remained just that...ideas. Hyundai BlueLink has failed to follow through with my requests for assistance on getting my BlueLink activated. I initially submitted a ticket on 1/8/21 and they have yet find a resolution as to why my BlueLink is not activating. On top of not being able to find a resolution yet, their communication with me regarding my ticket has been virtually non-existent. The initial rep I spoke with, the one I filed a ticket with, stated they would either have a resolution of follow up with me in 3-5 business days...7 days later with no response, I had to contact BlueLink to get an update. They gave me a vague answer stating ""yep, engineers are still working on it, we will follow up in 3-5 business days"". Again, 7 days later with no response, I contacted BlueLink for an update; I got the same answer as before. Again I waited 7 business days to follow up where I then requested to speak with a supervisor. The supervisor was helpful (although he couldn't give me any more of answer as to what was going on behind the scenes) he did make it a point to call me back the following Friday. Unfortunately, this supervisor told me that day was going to be his last day (surprise, surprise, I'd be looking for another job too since communication was probably an issue for him too). After that conversation I heard nothing more from Hyundai BlueLink. Fast forward to this last weekend...My husband and I left for a road trip and guess what? My new car broke down on us! And, you guessed it...because my BlueLink issue had yet to be resolved we were unable to diagnose what the check engine light was for AND road side assistance had issues locating us.Fast forward again, we get my car to a Hyundai dealership. They are unable to read the check engine light because their Hyundai software isn't working! 2 rental cars, 1 night in a hotel and 3 days later....I get a call from Jobe at Hyundai BlueLink. He asks if I can access the head mount to try something. I let him know that no...I can't, because my vehicle is 200 miles away at the dealership getting worked on. He then asks if he can call me back in a week for me to try whatever it was he was wanting with the head mount....I asked if he could simply contact the dealership where my car is at so that they (being the so called Hyundai/BlueLink professionals) could troubleshoot and get it fixed...thinking that would be the easiest, most logical approach to getting this issue resolved. I guess I thought wrong, Jobe continued on (talking over me and getting obviously flustered) stated that was not something they could do because the engineers don't communicate with the dealerships or something like that, to be honest his response did not make sense. It is very likely that I just do not understand how there business operations work, however, with their history of poor communication, I also find it likely that Jobe just didn't know how to respond to my question. Jobe ultimately said that he would contact the dealership where my car is at...who knows what will happen at that point...that is if he or anybody at BlueLink follows up for that matter.I will be posting this review on every platform I can in hopes that the right people at Hyundai/BlueLink find this message, they should know what a disappointment it has been to work with their company."

Hyundai forces you to buy a service you may not want (I didn't).  Not a good business model.  I canceled everything.  When enough people do that (and I had a BlueLink Rep tell me the drop off rate is ""ridiculous"") then maybe Hyundai will offer a reasonably priced, buy only what you want option.  p.s. the App works fine most of the time and we would have renewed if not being forced to spend an extra $99 on something we absolutely did not want."

Save your money and only use it in the winter months if you really need it. Other than that, use any map app on your phone to keep track of where you parked your car. It misses half the commands because it won't connect, most of the time in the morning when I would try and start my car to leave the house. The rest of the features you probably won't use.

B077VXVF8D,NissanConnect® EV,Connected Car,Neal Kinney,4.0 out of 5 stars,It Really Works even on an Antique 2011 Leaf,"Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2018","Being the original owner of a 2011 Leaf, I have become dubious of anything that Nissan claims is ""new!"" Today I was offered Alexa integration... and after a stumbling start, I was impressed. Stumbling only because I needed to link my ""My Nissan"" account to Alexa and I have about four versions of these accounts as I tried and failed to get Carwings to work in a satisfactory fashion. Anyway, with the right account (now titled Nissan Connect) tied to Alexa, I gave her the first example presented on my skill screen which was ""Alexa ask Nissan Connect EV to check the battery status on my Leaf.""  She immediately dismissed my command as nonsense (soft ding) but no comment.  I tried again but slower as you would speak to someone not familiar with English. This time I got a more formal rejection ""I don't know how to do that."" Okay... I switch from my living room Echo to my office Echo Show and tried one more time. I got silence as the blue ""working on it"" bar cycled and then (soft ding) nothing.  Blast it! Okay, one more time... carefully enunciating every syllable... ""Alexa, ask Nissan Connect EV to check the battery status on my Leaf"" And after a moment, with blue bar cycling, Alexa said ""One moment while I process your request"" and a moment later she reported a lot more than I asked for including the charging voltage and the expected finish time and even offered to send a notice to my preferred Email or SMS address when charging was complete.  It worked. I found that if I mixed the words to check my Leaf battery status, Alexa didn't do it... but if I stuck to the quoted sentence above, it worked every time.  Great. On the down side, I wish that the skill command were a bit more simple than what is required (perhaps ""Ask Nissan Connect to check my Leaf battery) and perhaps the result might be more accurate: Alexa reported that my battery was 133% charged and would be fully charged in 30 minutes.  133%?  Wow. Heck with buying a new 2018 Leaf when my old 2011 can be rejuvenated so easily via Alexa.  I love this addition and will use it frequently!"

Same for me.  Alexa understands the long, awkward command about one time out of ten.  Wish I knew whether it was Nissan, or Amazon, or a 3rd party who is responsible for this failure, but I don't, so this is the only place I know to give the feedback.  IT BARELY WORKS.  PLEASE FIX IT.It would be 100 times better even if something simple would work.For instance, make it understand this:""Alexa, check the battery on my Nissan LEAF.""The only part of that Alexa would understand is the ""Alexa,"" part."

It refuses to find and update from my car.  The Alexa skill does enable, and after you link the account with the appropriate credentials, Alexa does connect.

The app ...,"Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2018","Have 2018 Leaf with Premium Connect services.  The app does work, but sporadically; Also, as others have stated, the command line is very long and awkward.  In addition, the various command lines do not follow the same pattern making its use from memory very difficult.  And some requests/commands are audibly answered while others just give a audible ding that request was processed.  In each case, I used the suggested wording to issue these commands.Example #1, using my Echo Show, I asked for battery status and only got an audible cue that it was processed (Response option set to Brief Mode); however, nothing heard about status or displayed on Echo Show.  When I opened Alexa app on phone, my question and response was displayed in the app.  I subsequently asked the same command and Alexa reported ""OK, it would do that, and then reported unable to do so at this time""Example #2, using Echo Show, I asked to sound the horn.  After a few seconds, the horn started blowing.Example, using Echo Show, I asked for doors to be locked.  Alexa responded and asked for my PIN.  Alexa reported it would send the command.If the app skill wording is shortened and made to follow same format, it would be much improved."

It doesnt cost anything to try it. It is pretty clunky, and like most Alexa skills, you have to say just the right thing to get the result you want.I found that saying “Alexa, Launch NissanConnect EV” will activate the service.

B01N9Y4I1E,My Tesla (Unofficial),Connected Car,SalisburySam,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Works when it works, which is only if car is awakened first.","Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2018","Easy parts: added skill to Alexa, linked account, all checked out.Hard part: don’t expect it to work quickly.  The command first has to awaken the car (Model 3) and get whatever info was asked for.  If car is awake, the response is very quick.  If not, Alexa will give a message about being unable to connect and that the car is either asleep or disconnected.  One workaround would be to preclude the car from going to sleep fully, but I think that’s a non-starter for me.  A solution might be to extend the time between when Alexa sends a signal to awaken the car and when Alexa asks for desired information sufficient to give the car time to awaken."

An Alexa phrase from the recent South Park Post Covid special actually worked to try to start my car... but I say the exact same phrase and Alexa is having trouble.  Occasionally the long ""Ask Nissan connect services to start my Rogue"" will work, but most of the time I have to launch the Skill from the Echo device, then it will work.  It's absolutely maddening not knowing what phrase will work and when.  It worked really good a while back, and now it's garbage!  Please fix it."
B074XBFTP3,NissanConnect Services,Connected Car,Melissa S,2.0 out of 5 stars,updated: try saying “start engine” - skill does not work and no help if you call them,"Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2021","I am updating my review to two stars because I believe I found the solution to the start command not working. At least this is working for the time being. Try saying “open NissanConnect Services”, then say “start the engine”. This has been working the last couple of days for me. I am still keeping it at two stars because I don’t know for how long this will work, and after several phone calls and even a callback from Amazon, no one could help me. I discovered this solution on my own, so hopefully it will work for someone else too.  I can’t believe no one knows the commands and they keep changing them.  She still does not recommend my vehicle name, Kicks, so I still cant say it.original review:Alexa says “I’m sorry I’m having trouble try it in a little while.” She also does not recognize the vehicle name kicks.  she wants to play Kicks 105 radio station instead of starting my car!  When I called Nissan connect services, all she could do is tell me to disable and re-enable the skill. Obviously that does not work!"
B074XBFTP3,NissanConnect Services,Connected Car,B C S,1.0 out of 5 stars,Useless,"Reviewed in the United States on September 13, 2018","Nissan Connect Services aka XMRadio and customer services are useless. This is my 2nd Nissan (unfortunately) and Nissan Connect again is giving exactly the same issues. Intermittent operation, app disconnect often, no SOS or customer care connection (busy signal), and Nissan keeps referring to the dealer for repair. The dealer has no idea what to do and just replaces the TCU which causes another set of problems,  because Nissan Conn aka XMRadio, cannot figure out what configuration is in the car after the orioginal TCU is replaced. Thus the system keeps disconnecting. This is my 2nd brand new Nissan and its doing the same as my old one."
B074XBFTP3,NissanConnect Services,Connected Car,I Am The Dark Side,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not useful at all,"Reviewed in the United States on January 22, 2020","this app is pretty useless as its integration is horrible.too many steps and voice commands to do something simple.me. “Alexa, tell NissanConnect Services to start my car”note, you cant just say “car”, you have to specify the modelAlexa. “You have NissanConnect Setvices enabled. Would you like to open it”why should it have to be ‘opened’ first?me. “yes”Alexa then blabs on about my taste in automobiles and asks for the PIN. Asking for pin is fine, dont need the extra commentary.Alexa. “The start command has been sent. Is there anything else I can do for you today?”me. “No”Alexa. “sorry I didnt understand that. if you would like help...” blah blah blahsee, actually it cant do anything else. the “do for tou@ and “help” is limited specifically to the skill itself.you cant ask Alexa anything else. Hell, you can even tell Alexa to stop or exit.me. “Alexa, exit”Alexa. “sorry I didnt understand that. if you would like help...” blah blah blahwhat should happen:1. Ask alexa to “have NCS start my car”2. Alexa says Ok, asks for pin. nothing more.3. give pin4. Alexa says OK and that the command was sent.done.(update 12/2021-over last year it hasnt been any better. still have to open the skill first, and still have to specify the model. now if you had 2 Nissans I could see why, but when you only have 1 car why “start my car” doesnt work is baffling."

E. Try saying...) no longer work. I don't want to have a conversation, and I don't need a friend. When I'm in a rush I simply want to say Tell Nissan Connect Services to start my maxima. then provide a pin. I don't want to go back and forth. I don't need to be told I have outstanding taste in automobiles, I don't need to be asked what I want to do even though I just said start my car. I don't need to be told to ask for help every time, and I don't need to be asked if there is anything else.At least add a setting so I can perminently switch between ""convenient"" and ""I really need a girlfriend"" mode.Also.. Every 3rd time I'm told I need to link my account and it just fails to work.This feels like a 5th grade computer project."

It started back working the next day.  I can once again remotely lock my car doors (from inside my home) using my phone or by asking Alexa to ""lock doors"" when she prompts me to at 9 PM each night.  It a 9 PM routine I've started doing, just to make sure they are locked each night.  I'm glad it's working again, and I hope it continues working.  ok, Nissan, I love you again.  I do think Nissan should offer their Connect Services as a standard feature included on all their cars (at least the basic connect services .. lock, crank, horn, lights, 911, find if stolen, etc.) -- NOT as a paid subscription service.  I would not pay a monthly subscription for this, so super glad it was included with my murano.  Thanks, Nissan.(2/10/2021) ...  it worked for a few weeks then stopped. reminds me of all the tech issues i'm having with my murano now, too.  it's a shame."

It also no longer works directly through the Eho / Alexa. You need to instruct your device to open the skill then execute the comments; it takes so much longer that way.

My service no longer worked after the three months but they continued to bill me, even though I could no longer use it.  After another half hour on the phone today and being transferred to three different people they refused to issue a credit for March, April and May.
