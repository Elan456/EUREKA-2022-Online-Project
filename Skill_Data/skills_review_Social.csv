B017YAF22Y,Ask My Buddy,Social,Quackenfuss,5.0 out of 5 stars,First Class App for Alexa,"Reviewed in the United States on March 27, 2018","I don't understand the reviews complaining about the cost of the service.  While I have no knowledge of how the web site presented information in 2016 and 2017, at the current time, March 2018, the website if very, very clear about cost.  The service is free if you have fewer than 5 contacts and use 10 or fewer notifications in a 30 day period.  For $3.66 a month you can use 120 notifications per month, and for $5 per month you can get 400 notifications per month, have 10 contacts, and use numerous languages other than English.  I signed up for the free service and tested it and it works flawlessly.  Since I opted for voice call and text, each instance uses 2 notifications, and because I am adding one additional contact, each notification will use 4 notifications.  For that reason I am going back into my account and signing up for the $5 per month option.  I am currently paying $32 per month for a medical alert system for my wife, but she fell this morning and wasn't wearing the necklace so it was of no help.  However, she has and Echo Dot on her bedside table, and if I had signed up for Ask My Buddy sooner, she could have just said, ""Alexa, alert Bill"" and Ask My Buddy would have called my cell phone.  The instructions say that you should say ""Alexa, tell Ask My Buddy to alert (contact name)"", but I quickly discovered that you only need to say ""Alexa, alert (contact name)"", and Alexa will respond with ""I will tell Ask My Buddy to alert (contact name)"".  That may seem lilke and inconsequential difference, but for an elderly person in distress, and possibly with confusion as well, the 3 word command is much surer than the 8 word command.  While I should be able to just say, ""Alexa, call (contact)"", I have found over the past few months that the Echo Dot response to that is spotty.  Sometimes it works, sometimes Alexa just lights up green and beeps, but never makes the call.  In any case, with that, the person in distress would have to communicate via Alexa which at distance could be difficult.  The Ask My Buddy command will send a prerecorded message that will tell you that the person in distress needs help and you should check on them immediately.  This is as good a use of technology as can be devised and I recommend it without reservation."
B017YAF22Y,Ask My Buddy,Social,NYCGuy,5.0 out of 5 stars,How to set up Ask My Buddy for a senior,"Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2019","Here is how we setup Ask My Buddy for my 97-year-old father who lives alone:1. Living room has an Echo. Bedroom and bathroom each have an Echo dot.2.  Taped next to each Echo device is a cheat sheet for the Ask My Buddy commands, of which he uses two: call all of us for help and tell all of us he's ok.3.  We schedule drills twice a month on the first and fifteenth of each month.  I verify with Pop the procedure and alert the other contacts in advance of each scheduled test.  He issues both commands during each test.4.  We rotate the tests so that he exercises each of his Echo devices in turn.5.  I frequently call in to his Echo device using the Alexa app on my android phone and the ""Drop in"" feature.  This lets me listen to his living room without his having to do anything to receive the call.6.  We will soon implement an additional, daily ""Check-In"" message from Pop to all of us.  Since we talk with him frequently, but not necessarily every day, this step will provide positive confirmation that he is all right at least once a day.These steps are necessary, because unless he rehearses sending messages he might not remember what to say in a real emergency."
B017YAF22Y,Ask My Buddy,Social,An0n1llus10n,4.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic. Highly recommend. Just wish 1 thing...,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2018","This skill is exactly as advertised. Absolutely fantastic.I only wish you could adjust a setting so you could just say “Alexa, alert so and so” rather than having to say “Alexa, tell MyBuddy to alert...”Could be hard to remember, especially for elderly/disabled persons, to say MyBuddy. Especially in an emergency situation and so infrequently using the skill."

B017YAF22Y,Ask My Buddy,Social,Jeff S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,A Perfect Combination of Technologies offering Freedom of Movement and Peace of Mind,"Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2016","Sometimes technologies can match up so well as to become nearly perfect solutions for some of the most challenging problems we face. Take the task of taking care of our elderly family and friends - Ask My Buddy steps up as one of those perfect solutions. It leverages Alexa's ""always on"" capabilities so that my blind 89-year-old father has the means to call out if his cell phone battery dies (which happened today), he falls or is otherwise in need of help at a time no one is around. This combination skill and service along with the voice-interface that Alexa provides gives my father freedom of movement and all of his family a greater sense of security.In fact, I think this company should be bought out by Amazon and incorporated into all Echo units by default since it offers such a vital service for anyone, not only the elderly, to send a quick message for help. It also isn't bad for Dot sales in that we are now buying 3 more Echo dots for various remote areas of the house to accommodate this skill's capabilites. Ask My Buddy rocks!"

B017YAF22Y,Ask My Buddy,Social,ROBERT J SMITH,5.0 out of 5 stars,IT DOES NOT GET ANY BETTER!!!!,"Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2016","My wife has MS and has fallen many times, only to be stuck for hours until someone came home. Echo is now her guardian as well as companion....Thank you so much. Who would of thought this was possible."
B017YAF22Y,Ask My Buddy,Social,Amy A. Dingfield,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect piece of mind for parents of new “latch-key” kid this school year!,"Reviewed in the United States on January 9, 2020","My daughter just started middle school this school year and now walks home from school.  We know our child very well and she is not responsible enough to have a standard cellphone.  We bought a tik-talk watch that allows her to call only the contacts we program in it, call 911 in an emergency, receive calls from anyone; that’s a bummer (and not okay for us) but understands it’s the same lesson about “don’t answer the door to anyone that’s not mom or dad!” She can send texts to the contancts in her list, too, and it’s trackable even inside a building!!What makes this app/skill perfect is, when she gets home, locks the door, and sets the house alarm she tells Alexa to have My buddy send everyone a “check-in” and my husband and I are notified via 3 means of communication (text message, email and phone call) that she’s made it home.  We know for a fact that if she had just a cell phone she would not develop this routine and forget to call us, we would be engrossed in our jobs at the time she gets home from school and be completely unaware that she didn’t check-in giving a potential problem a headstart on the clock.  Now I am not saying the skill will save my childs life!  But this skill provides our family some piece of mind, and because of the routine notifications it has helped us to recognize our patterned behaviors and know when we’re doing a specific thing/task during the day is when to expect her notification; again adding that piece of mind!One thing I would change about this skill is the notification system.  I wish it would allow you to choose your preference(s) of notification between text message, email, or phone call or and of those as a combination.  My preference would be to have both the text message and phone call but I don’t need or want the email notifications."
B017YAF22Y,Ask My Buddy,Social,Wally,3.0 out of 5 stars,Alert First Responders By Voice,"Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2021","I am primarily using AskMyBuddy as an inexpensive Medical Alert system.AskMyBuddy can contact either the Fire or Police departments, however I would, typically, use 911.PROSVery low monthly cost.Voice activated. No need to wear a pendant. (Seniors HATE that pendant.)CONSRequires Amazon Echo smart speaker devices throughout your dwelling. (I have four to cover my 2400 square foot condo.)Very difficult for a senior to set up without help, because it requires AskMyBuddy, Buddy Assist, your smartphone, Alexa, Noonlight, and a lockbox. (Your traditional Medical Alert services are, essentially, turnkey.)The AskMyBuddy commands are too wordy, and could be hard to remember under stress. (This can be solved using an Alexa Routine with a Custom command, e.g. Alexa, Call medical, or Alexa, Help!)I'm eighty years old, but I was a computer guy in my previous life. It was a struggle, but I had fun setting this up. All the pieces are available, but the AskMyBuddy folks need to do some fine tuning."
B017YAF22Y,Ask My Buddy,Social,Stevie P,5.0 out of 5 stars,My Mom Fell,"Reviewed in the United States on August 30, 2017",My mom fell last week and was unable to get up. She alerted family via Ask My Buddy and we were then able to summon EMS. Awesome App
B017YAF22Y,Ask My Buddy,Social,A. Versalles-Curtis,5.0 out of 5 stars,Alert your Alerts!,"Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2016","Getting signed in and adding contacts was very simple. Just make sure you've gotten a hold of everyone before testing the alert! I thought I texted all my contacts before testing the alert message and missed one. Scared her half to death. After assuring her I was fine we had a good laugh. So, heads up people!"
B017YAF22Y,Ask My Buddy,Social,Jude525,5.0 out of 5 stars,An amazing free service,"Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2017","I haven't had to use this in an emergency, but I have run a couple tests and the system has worked as hoped. Set up was incredibly easy.While it isn't a factor on the Alexa app, I have to say that the development team is excellent. After setting up on my Echo Dot I contacted the development team about using it on my PC and they were right there explaining what I had missed in the set up. They have followed up twice with me checking if I have questions on either device. You don't usually get service this good for paid apps!I have two conditions that make me prone to falls, but neither one is severe enough for my insurer to pay for a traditional emergency button. Although Ask My Buddy isn't the same as a  911 service, it does take some of the fear away from my being alone. Especially at night when I am tired and most afraid to fall.Finally, if like me, you can't afford the subscription service, consider making a one time donation to the team. It costs them money to run this and, unlike the games we all play daily, there are no in app ads here."
B017YAF22Y,Ask My Buddy,Social,Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful APP.....Thank You.,"Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2016","This is a fantastic addition to Alexa.

B017YAF22Y,Ask My Buddy,Social,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great and I am lucky I have set this up.,"Reviewed in the United States on May 18, 2018","This why I first got an Amazon Echo. Ask My Buddy works great and is great peace of mind for someone like me.  I have taken a few falls and was worried about what to do without my phone being available.  I have now used Ask my Buddy with another fall.  My kids all got the message and when they could not reach me on my phone came over to help me.  I think anyone who lives alone should have something like this, no matter what their age.  Oh I forgot, I use the check in feature every morning to let them all know I am up and about."

B017YAF22Y,Ask My Buddy,Social,Carolyn Timmerman,5.0 out of 5 stars,An AMAZING Skill!,"Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2018","We needed something to help protect a dear loved one in the event he was unable to call for help - for ANY reason. An independent man, who has always taken care of so many others, was willing try out what I initially thought would be a ‘good thing’. I wanted something that was discreet, accurate, easy to use, waterproof (showers), and would last. What I bought, although it has great potential, was not a good fit. It alarmed FREQUENTLY, for no reason. If he heard the alarm ‘voice message’, he could cancel the alert, but more times than not, it sent out alerts and I would contact him to verify he was okay as much as 10 times in a single day! It wasn’t for him. While searching for a more workable solution, I came across Ask My Buddy and thought this could be the ONE! I bought 4 AMAZON Echo/Alexa Dots and shared this skill. He had all the Dots by Thanksgiving; set up 1 Dot just to appease me (read that as...shut me up!). I e-mailed him a lengthy list of all the stuff/skills I use my Alexa for, and he did start with a shopping list. The next morning, he CALLED me via his DOT! He read all the stuff I’d sent, and hooked everything up Thanksgiving night! We enabled the Ask My Buddy skill, tested it out, and it worked beautifully! I can honestly say, I was reduced to tears! So thankful! The Dots were placed strategically around the house; upstairs, downstairs, just outside the bathroom, and the garage - all able to hear from 2 locations - and we are all very pleased. The second best part of my story/review? I learned yesterday that he bought 3 more Dots to give to his sisters...and shared the Ask My Buddy skill! ❤️"
B017YAF22Y,Ask My Buddy,Social,Lora,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works Perfectly,"Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2019",I just finished setting this up for myself as I live alone. All of my contacts got notified immediately and let me know so we’re all set. I fell and broke my knee a few months ago so I’ve been finding this very exciting to have as it will alert everyone all at once.I was trying to reach one daughter before and she was not available so this gives me back up.
B017YAF22Y,Ask My Buddy,Social,OCShopper,5.0 out of 5 stars,It really works!,"Reviewed in the United States on November 20, 2016","I have mine set up for my mom who lives w me, so when I'm away from home she can activate if necessary. Last night, was being demonstrated on tv and highlighting the &quot;ask my buddy&quot; app.  Well my Alexa heard the command and the next thing I know my cell phone rings and text message is sent telling me to check on my mom! Of course I knew she was fine sitting across the room from me. The kicker was that my husband out of town also called in not knowing it was a &quot;test/mistake&quot; and wanted to make sure everything was ok. Brilliant!!"

B017YAF22Y,Ask My Buddy,Social,FelineFriend,5.0 out of 5 stars,Was needed within 2-weeks,"Reviewed in the United States on June 6, 2017","I haven't had to use 'Ask My Buddy' for myself but, I have peace of mind knowing it's there.  I did sign up my parents for this service and 2-weeks later my mom fell down the stairs and injured her hip.  She did not have her cell phone on her and was too far away from the house phones to reach them.  It took about 10-minutes (to get over her initial panic) but, then she remembered 'Ask My Buddy' and called out for help.  I got to her within 30-minutes and was able to call an ambulance.  I am so glad this service is available."

A must have!,"Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2020","This is so helpful, and a safety must have.You just say:  Alexa, ask my buddy for help. and immediately your designated ""buddy"" or buddies receive a phone call and a text. When I go food shopping and my husband- who has severe disabilities - falls, or needs me urgently- can simply call out to Alexa, and I am alerted immediately.  This is awesome... and a relief. :)"

When my best friend showed up a few days ago with an Echo Dot, in hopes that I would be able to use it in an emergency, I immediately began looking for some way to manage this easily.  Last night I found this skill - read many many positive reviews - thought about it overnight - and decided to give it a whirl this morning. I went to the website and signed up first, added my contacts' information, then came back here and enabled the skill and linked it by signing into the site thru the link dialogue above. Then I tested it out with my two friends, and with one small adjustment (Alexa couldn't understand one friend's name, so I went back to the contact page and gave him an easier-to-understand nickname instead) everything worked flawlessly!  It was a very straightforward setup, and now both my friends and myself can breathe a bit easier, knowing that as long as Alexa is working, I can call for help.  Thank you so much, devs!!"
B017YAF22Y,Ask My Buddy,Social,glmccready,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great idea, difficult implimentation.","Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2020","I have a rare neuromuscular disease, and sometimes become paralysed.  Ive got echo dots all over the house to help me “control” my environment....lights, temp, locks, even some doors.  I have gone from nearly normal to paralysed in less than 5 minutes....and i need to be medicated immediately. Ive tried to set this up for my wife. During the “testing” phase I’d say “ask my buddy for help ”, and everytime it would suggest i setup the app...which I’d already done mutiple times. So here is the problem, as I figure.  You have to say “ask my buddy to help me..and not “for help”.  Honestly Im not sure I’d remember that as I “go down the rabbit hole”.  Customer support was awesome....but for now still carrying the meds around all the time,  using Alexa’s announce function, boat horns, and carry my phone."
B017YAF22Y,Ask My Buddy,Social,DiscerningConsumer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than free,"Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2017","This is a free service for everyone who has an Amazon Echo. The basic service will let you notify close family/friends in an emergency, and that's all most folks really need. Let the family members and friends you list as emergency contacts know that you've put them down to receive a text or voice call if you have an emergency. (This Echo skill does NOT call 911 directly).Contributing a few bucks a year lets you list more than 5 contacts and is totally optional. Any contribution is a nice way to support an important service, and even if you stop contributing none of your contacts will be de-listed. This Echo app is way cheaper than the emergency alert services that sponsor annoying TV ads for dedicated hardware devices for those living alone.Highly recommended."
B017YAF22Y,Ask My Buddy,Social,Steve Linthicum,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for Seniors,"Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2018","We've all seen that commercial ""I've fallen down and can't get up."" The challenge with that line of products is it requires people to wear a wrist band or pendant that holds the button triggering the system. As a resident in a 55+ senior community, and qualifying as a senior by age, I've started helping neighbors put the Alexa Dot - Ask My Buddy solution in place where they can use this skill to issue the ""ask my buddy to alert"" command, contacting neighbors and family when there is an emergency need."
B017YAF22Y,Ask My Buddy,Social,Jim,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I appreciate this was created, however many in need aren't going to remember to say ""Ask My Buddy""","Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2019","From experience, people in need aren't going to remember or give a crap about saying ""Alexa"" or ""Ask My Buddy"" before they state their need.  What they will say with instinct, realizing there is or isn't a device that can hear them, is something to the affect ""Help me, Help me.  Oh it hurts, I need help, please help me.  Can anyone help me? Call 911 or do something, please help me.""By then, any device, Alexa or otherwise, should have heard at least ""help"" enough to trigger and ask for further information.  ""Do you need me to alert the house, or call 911?""It's a good approach and a good thing for you to start, because this is already necessary and right now.  People in dire need don't think, they just react."

Everyone was notified in seconds and I truly mean seconds! Just having it there put my mind and my family members minds a little more at ease. This skill is absolutely amazing.

Brahm,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Customer Service,"Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2019","A basic account (allowing for a limited number of alerts per month) is completely free, so it came as a surprise that AskMyBuddy has such great customer service!  I was having trouble linking Alexa to my mother's AskMyBuddy account, so I emailed their support, and they called me right back and talked me through an alternate approach, which worked.  It was the best customer service I've ever received from a free product!

Like most folks these days, I ignore, even block those unknown, always annoying out of state nuisance calls.  Should be able to reflect a recognizable name, like ""Ask My Buddy Needs You"" or something similar.This would make it a solid 5 Star App, in my opinion."

B017YAF22Y,Ask My Buddy,Social,Remlan,5.0 out of 5 stars,I cannot begin to say how much I LOVE this life saving app,"Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2017","Awesome app! I had one of the telephone boxes that require a sizable monthly service charges that continually increased in cost. That service took as long as five to ten minutes to respond, though it had no problem coming on (without using the cumbersome button necklaces or bracelets) in the middle of the night waking everyone just to be discovered to have been a case of a malfunction or accidently touching a button. The box hummedconstantly, lots of static and it ate electricity. I finally gave up and ended the service. NOW I have this. With two Echoes in my home I am always within voice range of Alexa! On a trial run, within 30 seconds, my hubby's cell phone rang with information that I needed help. I have him set as a voice answer on his cell phone and two others set to receive texts because that is what they use most often. Now everyone is happy because I can get immediate help.  If you can afford a small donation, they are pleased but if not, they only ask for a good review! As someone in poor health, I feel much safer than I did with the over priced box. This is a win win situation and it works VERY well! I am a retired nurse and highly recommend it for anyone with health problems who may not be able to reach a phone OR forgets to always wear that large button necklace or bracelet all the time. I feel better when alone and so do my loved ones. Highly recommended for anyone with health issues who may not be able to afford 40.00  or so, each month for something they may not ever use, or have access to. This is the best thing EVER! Thank you SO much for this fabulous service. It is the best I've ever even tested. I am in for the long haul!"

B017YAF22Y,Ask My Buddy,Social,Krista HRK,4.0 out of 5 stars,Peace of Mind!,"Reviewed in the United States on April 4, 2017","I can only echo what everyone else is saying... I haven't had to use Ask My Buddy  (and I sure hope I never have to) but this definitely has given me peace of mind should something happen to me at home. I tested the feature with my emergency contact and he said he received a text message and a phone call telling him to go check on me.The ONLY reason I'm giving this 4 stars is because since it's not something I use regularly, I always forget what I'm suppose to say should I have an emergency. And one thing I'm learning about Alexa and these various ""skills"", you need to make sure you give the correct command or otherwise Alexa may not understand what you're asking!"

I have Amazon Echos in two areas of my home so wherever I am, Alexa can hear me in the event I should ever need help and my smartphone isn't handy. I can choose to reach out to all of the contacts entered into the Buddy app or just one. A trial run confirmed that the text and email time is immediate so there's no waiting for an attendant to respond."

I do live in a nice area with an extremely low crime rate, but you never know!  I chose to donate/pay so that we could have 10 contacts.  I have tested it and it does work.  Within 1-2 seconds it sends out a phone call, email, and text to my designated contact (or ALL if you say, ""Alexa, ask my buddy, alert everyone."") I have also taught my 10 year old how to use it as well.  The name sections can hold a lot of info so I have my county and township info listed as well - to make it easier - if something were to happen."

B017YAF22Y,Ask My Buddy,Social,nancy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Recommend to everyone I see!,"Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2017",Awesome skill!! My husband has had some health problems in the last few years. Electronics and computers frustrate him. Echo allows him to give voice commands and this skill allows him to alert me at work if something is wrong. I told my sister because she works in an assisted living setting. She said this will be a great recommendation for the residents there. They are sometimes given an alert for their neck but it alerts the facility only and due to liability issues they can not help them if they fall. How nice it will be for them to alert their son or daughter to come help them?!?
B017YAF22Y,Ask My Buddy,Social,Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Needs simplicity,"Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2017","The concept is fabulous, however the execution could be simpler.  Instead of having to say ""ask my buddy"", could you simplify to use the word ""help"" to open the app, then ""call (by name)"", or ""call #1 (by contact number)"".  The first two contacts would be the most prevalent with possibly up to 5 contacts by order of importance, or have the ability to say ""contact all"".  This is a great app for older adults, and even children, but in an emergency, the simpler the better."

Ask My Buddy works as advertised in the testing I've done and it' s easy to set up.  This is great peace of mind for someone like me who lives alone and is 68.  Even though I am fit and healthy it's easy enough to trip and fall, or slip in the shower.  I tested Ask my Buddy with my contact on the phone and no sooner than I said the phrase to Alexa, he got a text, email and phone call.  I think anyone who lives alone should have something like this, no matter what their age."

It is a great comfort to know that I can call for help from almost any room in my home for simply $3.95/month.  I always have my phone near me or at least close by.  I don't have to pay a lot more than that to have something hanging around my neck. Try Ask My Buddy; it works!  I had to use it about 3 months ago and my son called me almost immediately.

In fact you may be able to add quasi 911 service as a contact if you can get the local dial-in number for their service rather than dialing 911 itself (Do not enter ""911"" as contact phone # as the calls are NOT generated locally to you, but from Florida).  One thing I found a little confusing though is Ask MY Buddies ""Messages "" Page. I finally figured out these msgs arent for actual alerts but for scheduled TESTS. So I put the word TEST in my msg in all caps to differentiate them from an actual alert when setting up monthly TEST scheduling for my primary contact.This service/app/Alexa Skill can save your life!"

She is nearly blind so using the phone is sometimes a challenge.  However, she uses Alexa to play books for her  so it is always with her in the house.  With Ask My Buddy, this means that if she is in trouble, I know she can reach me and the other emergency contacts.  I have tested it and it is amazing how fast the alert is sent to every way there is to reach me.  A very valuable service!  My heartfelt thanks to those that created it and maintain it."

B017YAF22Y,Ask My Buddy,Social,F. R. Cox,5.0 out of 5 stars,One of Alexa's Best Skills!,"Reviewed in the United States on April 5, 2017",This is such a wonderful service and quite a bargain when compared to the other Life Alert or Live Line type services.  I've found that these services charge you anywhere from $9.99 to $39.99 Per Month and do little more than Ask My Buddy does. I can attest to this because I paid one of them $39.99 per month for several years for my mom.  Bottom line is we want a service that if/when we fall we can call out and get some help from our friends or emergency services.  Ask My Buddy does this function very well through Alexa and is only asking $10 every 3 Months to help maintain their services.  It is well worth the money and I highly recommend!

They all got a phone call and text message that I needed help.  Of course I let them all know ahead of time that I was doing a test.  I'm so impressed I'm going to buy an Echo for my mother.  The peace of mind of having this is priceless..  Thank you for such a wonderful App.  I honestly don't know why anyone wouldn't want this.  And to the person who wrote a review about them not letting you go any further without giving them money, is not true.

Having Alexa with the Ask My Buddy app that allows me to simply say Alexa ask my buddy and then name one or all and have a text or phone call sent immediately  saying I need help is more security than I ever thought I would have.  As of yet I have not had to use it but I have tested it with family and friends and it works. It brings a sense of security when I am home alone.  This would be great for parents that have teenagers at home that might need  to contact a parent in an emergency or anyone else. It is an amazing app that sends for help when you need it .  An ambulance or the police are not always what you need in an emergency.

I just changed the spelling... but I'd like to see perhaps the top contact be contacted for ANY reason... maybe ask my buddy is all I could say before I pass out...

B017YAF22Y,Ask My Buddy,Social,Brandon Slattery,4.0 out of 5 stars,A step in the correct direction,"Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2015","I'm giving 4 stars because I believe this may have pioneered an idea for Alexa that I'm all for- not only to be used as a life alert system, but for text messaging functionality in general.Although this doesn't fit a need for me specifically, I downloaded it interested in the functionality.  I enjoyed sending a text to my SO with a few words and adds a lot of novelty to the echo.That being said, I think the ask my buddy skill has been obsoleted with the integration of IFTTT.  I now set a trigger, I.E.- ""Alexa, trigger Send mom I love you text"" and IFTTT sends the text I pre-wrote to the number I define.  This is awesome...but I still want more.Using IFTTT, I've been able to send pre-written texts, and even call my own phone (find my phone) so the functionality is there.  How long until I can ask Alexa ""Call my secretary"" or ""send a text to Jim saying ""sorry brother, I'm gonna be a little late""  How long until I can use skype through alexa?These are the things we REALLY want.  The skill here may be obsoleted by triggers, but 4 stars for developing more useful applications than making fart sounds for this exciting technology."

I absolutely love this!  I don't have to wear the button and have Alexa/Dots on each floor of my house.  I only hope that Ask My Buddy continues to stay around for this wonderful service. Thanks for making me feel safe!"

When I'm sitting in my electric wheelchair and have braces on my arms and hands, I can dial a speakerphone or slowly type on a keyboard. But when I'm lying in bed, I have no movement. If my home started on fire when I was in bed and home alone, I'd burn to death. I am very lucky to have a woman who loves me, despite everything. For years, I have worried about how I could get help should something happen to her when I'm in bed -- a slip in the shower, a heart attack, any number of things.Immediately after getting my echo, I looked into how to use it to get help. This app has given me the peace of mind I've sought for many years. I am more than grateful to the team behind this app. And while I hope I never have to use it, I am deeply thankful to the developers who created this app. It's effective. I've tested it several times. For the record, I have no relationship whatsoever to the developers of this app, nor am I receiving any payment for this review. It's heartfelt, not bought. In fact, I donated as much as I could to Ask My Buddy so they might help others."

B017YAF22Y,Ask My Buddy,Social,jjaquinta,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Mildly useful, but very open for abuse","Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2015","This can send an alert or message to a list of people you give by e-mail, phone or text.Ease of Use: 3 out of 5. As with any skill using a linked account, this is a little tricky to negotiate. It took me a few times and some puzzlement to work it out. I was a little leery giving it several contact methods for many people. I looked at the terms and conditions but they were typically long and cryptic. There was no clear statement that I could easily see saying that my info was not being sold. I blanked out my information after reviewing, but there was no way to delete your account.Usefulness: 3 out of 5. If you are buying an echo for an elderly relative, there can be some advantage to this app. It works well for the ""I've fallen and can't get up"" scenario. But not so well for just about any other scenario. Maybe when there are more Alexa devices out there and you can use this from your smartphone or car, there will be more use.It's also great if you want to spam or harass someone.Novelty: 4 out of 5. There have been one or two calendar integration apps. But this is the first general alert one. I'm happy to see that it sends fixed messages, instead of attempting low quality free format text. As a sender of canned messages go, this could be useful for a variety of things. Say if the web end could be connected up to IFTTT.Overall: 2 out of 5. I cannot, in good conscience, give this a rating based solely on quality. Up until a few months ago I was an Ethical Hacker, and got a very firm schooling in security and privacy. You can use this skill to set up several contacts with a variety of contact methods and then effortlessly blast out a message to them as often as you like. There is no opt-in. The only way the sender is identified is how they choose to be identified. There's no way, as a recipient, to stop the messages. Sure, if used as intended, it is beneficial. But there is huge potential with this for harassment and abuse."

We don't have a home phone and if something were to happen to my mom, my girls might not be able to find her phone and make a call in an emergency. Ideally if there was a life and death emergency, they would call 911, but I am not sure 4yos are a good judge of that and I am just as happy that they can use the app to alert an adult in our family and let us triage the situation if the adult with this isn't able to help. We have tested this a couple of times with them and it has worked well. Thank you so much for the direction and reminder pages on your site. It has all the information about how to use the app and I put them on the front of my fridge and next to Alexa so my kids could reference them in an emergency. The Alexa UI is such that for apps you have to use a somewhat unnatural phrase, but with the reminder cards, you have a better chance of remembering it. I think it is also important to practice this skill (having first warned any alert contacts) and keep the relevant phrases in your mind.I can see that this could have a huge impact for elderly people that want independence, but also might need to call for help verbally. This is a great idea and while I hope I never have to REALLY use it, it gives me some peace of mind that it is there if we need it."

It provides a way for you to send alerts to one or all of your contacts letting them know you need help.  Perhaps you have fallen or are suddenly experiencing frightening symptoms, and you want to notify your son/daughter or care companion that something is occurring.  Send them an alert through AskMyBuddy!  You simply say, ""Alexa, ask my buddy to alert <first name of your contact>.  It's done.  I have not yet had an incident that required my use of this skill, but just knowing it is there gives me a measure of peace of mind.When you install Alexa, make this your first new skill.  Enabling is free.NB:  AskMyBuddy does NOT call 911 for you, nor should it be considered a substitute for calling 911 in case of unusual, potentially life-threatening symptoms (like sudden chest pain), for managing a pesonal medical emergency.  CALL 911 FIRST!  Then, if you are able, invoke AskMyBuddy (see above) to let the necessary contacts know you're having a problem."

My biggest issue with Alexa is that there are trigger words for apps. When I ordered Alexa with the hopes of it having abilities added like this, I had no idea I would have to remember trigger words for added capabilities especially in an emergency. Unless I practice these trigger words on a regular basis, I highly doubt I will remember them when needed the most. I keep trying to associate saying ""Alexa ask my buddy..."" with this emergency. Why is it not ""Alexa I've fallen and I can't get up..."" Or at least ""Alexa I have an emergency...""The site does have where you can print out these trigger words and put them in places that you might fall.  I find that idea ridiculous that it's needed in the first place.  Amazon, I expected much much better than these app add ons with trigger words."

The idea of only having to yell out to Alexa to alert someone on my list is great as I do not think it's going to be that easy to get around at first.  I took one star away because AMB does not indicate who is calling.  It comes up unknown.  When the voicemail picks up AMB begins speaking then when you go back later to check who called all you will receive is a noise.  Many people do not pick up unknown callers.  The good thing about this is if your contact has e-mail or is able to receive texts, they will receive the alert there."

B017YAF22Y,Ask My Buddy,Social,Bazinga,1.0 out of 5 stars,I'd give it -5 if I could.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 10, 2016","FYI, for any potential users:  This app might be free, but you must pay for the ""Ask My Buddy"" service, which you don't find out about until AFTER you create an account. Extremely unhappy.  My elderly mother bought an Echo just for this service, and was led to believe it was free and it is not free.  The info, as we were in the process of signing her up, stated that if she couldn't afford to pay, that she could sign up for free, however there was absolutely no way possible to do this.  The fine print then goes on to reveal that they are a volunteer-based service and please be 'kind'.  They also discourage leaving bad reviews!  I'm sorry, but I think others should know about this false advertising. If I can help one person from buying an Echo just for this service (by being misled) then my time was worth it.  My anger here lies with the 'Ask My Buddy' folks for shamefully misleading an elderly woman.  I do love Amazon and my own Echo, but I'm wondering if Amazon has any fault here.  Surely I cannot be the only customer with this issue.  I think they should advertise ahead of time that you must pay a fee every three months for the service.  Why hide this fact?  Give people a choice before they shell out money for the Echo.  Just seems shady and I don't like it at all. Also of note, the Ask My Buddy website (wwwaskmybuddy.net) has no mention of a fee anywhere on the page. As a matter of fact, it falsely states that ""Ask My Buddy is a free service that leverages Amazon’s Alexa Voice Platform to connect a user to their Personal Alert ⨁ Network using only their voice. The service is designed for ease of use by all customers, and is a favorite of senior and mobility challenged individuals. Ask My Buddy is not a substitute for 911, but rather an additional tool for those trying to preserve their independence, offering the security of knowing help is just a shout away"".LIES LIES LIES.  All lies and false advertising!  Buyer beware."

I didn't see an error message returned, otherwise I would have included that in my issue.Finally, as a customer, I don't care if you have thousands using the product, if I'm having an issue, your goal should be to work with me to resolve the issue, not telling me that you disagree with my comment, you jerk.

B06XHQFLGX,Life360,Social,Phred Broughton,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Using named locations and notifications, almost there","Reviewed in the United States on March 16, 2018","A previous comment stated they had to listen to a full days worth of notifications to get rid of them. Not sure if this was added in response, but I just ask Alexa to ""cancel all notifications"" and she will verify (yes/no) and if yes will delete all of them. Using named locations with this feature it is nice to hear that my daughter arrived at or left school etc. Unfortunately it doesn't capture the current time when the notification is created and include this in the message body so unless you are sitting there right when the notification appears, there is no way to know when (my daughter got to school etc. ) There is an open feature request to add this and hopefully it will be possible soon as this would make these much more valuable, but I am still very pleased with this skill in general.  It saves me from having to grab my phone, open the app, wait for location updates and then see where my family is with just one question to Alexa. Nice! Keep up the good work 😎"

First you must tell Alexa to open 360, then you have to listen to her explain the basics of what you need to do next... After that you got one shot of asking her the right thing, and you have to be very precise in what you're needing. If you don't get it right, whether she understands you or not, the skill will exit and you have to call it again to open it and start over.

It locked the location of one member of the family in the middle of nowhere no matter where they are and says “sorry I am having trouble accessing your Life360 skill right now” for everyone else. I reached out to Life360 customer support and they refuse to help and made up a sudden story that the Alexa skill is in beta and so no support. What nonesense, with several years of ok operation and 2200 reviews. Beta, ha! To be “fair”, Life360 support has never been in any way useful for other Life360 issues either, so the expectation of competent customer service is not justified. App (non-Alexa) works fine for everyone and I am a two circle paid customer (but won’t be when they expire in spring 2020 — no interest to support an incompetent failing product)."

It notifies for every location instead of respecting the settings from the app on which places to notify for each user.It needs the ability to tell you if someone is moving instead of telling you which street they’re near as if they’re parked. it also should tell you how far away they are if they’re moving since if you’re asking you’re probably waiting for them to arrive.it would also be nice if it showed the map on the echo show. it seems like they didn’t put much effort into the skill and just pumped it out to say they had one.

It's nice to be able to ask where circle members are, but two things are really irritating. One is the long message that follows a request to open Life 360. It is unnecessary. It is also irritating and totally unncecessary to be told how long it'll take to get to or from a family member's location. I have never used Life 360 for that purpose and doubt anyone else does either. Because of that, I'm sure I'll end up not using this feature. It's faster to find locations on my phone or on the web."

Hence, I tried out this one.  It shows up under Your Skills > Blueprint in the Alexa app.It’s basically what the description says it is.  I looked at my Echo Show and invoked the Skill.  Alexa displayed a flash card with a pink-ish background and musical instruments on it, which displayed a single sentence on it.  In total, there were 3 different flash cards and Alexa read the words as she rotated through each of the three cards.  The sentences were:1. Good fathers make good sons.2. Noble fathers have noble children.3. My Dad is my best buddy.That’s it.  I don’t know if the greetings change from time to time.  That’s what played on 8/3/19 and 8/11/19.  On my Dot, Alexa read the sentences.Do I love this Skill?  Um, probably not.  It’s a very basic execution of the Skill and the greetings aren’t what I’d say to my Dad.  Do I like it?  I like the concept of it.  There’s no reason why every day can’t be father’s day."

From account setup (your site is so insecure it sends to spam filters) to attempting to add responses (audio not accepted, video not accepted, multiple formats tried), to the fact that there is no help or guidance or ability to access any kind of request for support at all - or that the website is so built insecurely that the basic browser functionality will not load any kind of ability to TRY anything that is even pre-loaded - the only thing this skill does do is answer to an Alexa question.

Well, I wish that there was a conversation happening between Alexa and myself. But that didn not happens, oh it was one-sided in that she did converse on many subjects but I could not respond or she didn't absorb or respond to my questions. . I do hope you will  work on a working skill for Alexa where she can respond to my remarks and questions. a way where she can answer spontaneously to my input and questions. Where we can have a nice chat about whatever. Where Alexa learns information as I use them in my response or in my questions. Wouldn't that be great?You do that  and you get five gold stars. 💝💰💗😁.I am an old senior, live alone and have no visitors. So I don't talk to anyone. I am content,  but having a  conversation and occasionally giggle with a ""friend "" when I feel up to it"" would be super!!💝🌷 So I am waiting for you to figure out how to do this.... Alexa hears my comment or questions and will need to learn it, understand it first of all, which involves a large word dictionary, but then she will need to understand somewhat what I meant in order to respond, laugh or retort or remark.

Daniel does a great job of filling me in on the latest Instagram news that I have a hard time finding other places. I trust that if something big happened, I know he’s going to talk about it. He also does a great job of presenting the information in a way that doesn’t make you feel stupid or  that he’s an elitist in the industry. It’s like he’s that cool TA in the Instagram 101 class that wants to ensure all the students ace the test. If it’s not news he’s always changing it up and keeping it interesting by bringing up topics people have questions about. A lot of these flash briefings can get repetitive after a while, either from the content or the hosts voice and Daniel doesn’t allow for either of those — he does great job of speaking naturally and changing his inflection and cadence daily to where he don’t sound too podcasty and the audience doesn’t naturally tune out."

B019YJAFPM,Ooma (Phone and Home Security),Social,Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Surprisingly Competent,"Reviewed in the United States on October 28, 2016","Given the absolutely disgraceful, unusable, pathetic, shameful, steaming pile of bits known as the Ooma app for Android, I did not expect this to work at all and for no one to ever fix everything wrong with it.  Therefore I am shocked, SHOCKED, to learn that there are not many bugs in here.  Yes, it works as advertised.  It has very few features, but they work.  5 stars when it supports features like &quot;skip message&quot; or &quot;delete message&quot; WHILE the message is playing.  Currently it does not support deletion at all, so adding &quot;do you want to delete or save&quot; as a prompt from Alexa at the end of the message would be a start, but to really make this skill a true convenience (versus a stupid pet trick to impress anyone unfortunate enough to wander into my kitchen) you need to be able to interrupt Alexa with &quot;skip&quot; or &quot;delete&quot;.  If you interrupt with &quot;Alexa, stop&quot; or any synonym such as &quot;Alexa, shut the __ up you ____ _____&quot; she does stop playing the message, but she also stops being in Ooma mode, so you have to start over again. Stupid Pet Trick.For people having trouble with getting Alexa to make calls: make sure you have given the contact you want to call a &quot;Display Name&quot; in the myooma website. Go to your contacts page, click in the display name box and put a ONE WORD NAME.  Alexa is a simpleton, confused by multiword proper nouns, names with numbers in them, people who spell their name wrong, foreigners, etc.  For example, give your sister Jackquileenee de la Rosa O'Rourkenstein a display name that Alexa can more easily understand, like &quot;Sis&quot; or &quot;Bob.&quot; If you have more friends than there are three letter names, you need to cut ties with some of them."
B019YJAFPM,Ooma (Phone and Home Security),Social,Kindle Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Neat trick, but very primitive functionality","Reviewed in the United States on July 17, 2017","Another reviewer remarked the Alexa was a simpleton and confused by proper nouns of more than one word.  I think there is another simpleton in this skill.  This is a very primitive skill.  This same reviewer called it a 'stupid pet trick'.  That is very apt.  Here is my take for what it's worth.Good: you can make it call a contact; Bad: that contact has to have a simple name.  I haven't tried it out fully enough to figure out if it will take more than one word.  It didn't recognize our favorite pizza place last night, and the name is two words, but I had just added the contact so I don't know yet if the issue was the name or trying to use a contact that I just added.Good: you can listen to voice mail; Bad: you can ONLY listen to new messages and if you speak it stops and skips to next message with no way to return to the previous message.  There is no delete, a poor man's skip, and no way to navigate messages.  In short the VM listen is almost, but not quite completely useless.  ""A stupid pet trick"".Another good feature that I have not tried yet is call a number.  However, I have not been impressed with Alexa's accuracy will long strings of digits.  It took about 20 tries to get the Weather Underground key to take, so I am not sure how will this would work, but 911 is a short string so I am hopeful that that would work.The skill is very primitive and I am hoping, but not terribly hopeful, that Ooma will take up some of the slack in their skill."

Yay!I had written a poor review previous to this one and had gone back and forth with Ooma Support regarding the fact that the link could  not be made to my Ooma account via the Alexa app.  After several emails and a link to the Amazon review page (showing poor reviews), I finally received a response saying that the Engineers had made some corrections and they had asked me to try it again and report back.  The skill was enabled and the link to the account now worked fine.One of the best things about this app is the ability to play my Ooma voicemails and the calls to contacts works flawlessly.  I'm really happy that had Ooma listened to this customer and, in fact, provided a rather speedy correction.  Thank you Ooma Support! :)"

If i ask Alexa to open ooma, alexa will give me a list of commands. That seems to be the way to get it to cooperate. It will dial calls but you have to pick phone up to complete the call, you dont use Amazon device to talk. It will retrieve messages. Four stars for clunky account linking and really limited usefulness in the sense i can reach my cell and do everything this can, easier in most cases."

B019YJAFPM,Ooma (Phone and Home Security),Social,Chuck,1.0 out of 5 stars,Ooma Alexa Skill Linking Does Not Work and Support from both Entities is Useless!,"Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2020","After numerous attempts on my own to link the Ooma skill with Alexa, I have up and tried to contact Amazon support. I first used the in app link to post my issue of the app not accepting my Ooma phone number and password as valid. I received a reply that was pretty much all the steps I had done on my own. So, I decided to then proceed to chatting with Amazon support about the problem. I was passed along to two different techs and was finally told that it was not Amazon's problem since it was a third party app and I should contact Ooma about the problem.So, I maneuvered my way through the Ooma web site to the chat support. So I explained my problem and was told that Ooma and Alexa could not be linked app to app and that they had to be physically connected. That was not something I had ever heard about anywhere. I was then hung up on in the chat with a big ""NO"" and the chat was ended immediately by the person from Ooma with no explanation. Very rude! I then proceeded to go to try the chat again to see how I was to physically link the Ooma to Alexa. Wouldn't you know I got the same person on the other end. I mentioned he had hung up on me and then proceeded to ask my question. He had no answer and simply pasted all the usual steps I had already done into his next message. I said I had done all that multiple times to no avail. He said then I need to contact assistance through the voice support.I contacted someone through voice support and after all the verification she reset my password and the wanted to finish the call. I asked that she please stay on the line so that I could verify that the change in password would let me link Ooma with Alexa. I had to go through all the procedures to log into Amazon to try the new password with the Ooma app and it still did not work. I asked what I could do next and she tells me that she is limited on how long she can spend on each call and that I should call back again. Then she starts telling me how great it was to help me. That takes a lot of nerve! So much for a company being interested in its customer satisfaction. Very disgusted with the Ooma-Alexa Skill and can't believe how rude and horrible Ooma's tech support is."

I’ve called customer service several times about it, to no avail.2) One must buy the $10/month premium service to see the name of the caller on your phone screen. The caller’s name should be basic info. This is a shoddy way to get an extra $10 from customers.3) Many customer service reps speak poor English and/or are not well trained.4) Beware! Ooma automatically provides Premium service for the first 2 months. If you don’t unsubscribe before the deadline, you will be charged.5) The website states a $39 charge for porting, but I was billed $45+. BTW, Comcast, from which my phone number was ported, does not charge for porting, so Ooma’s charge is robbery.PS: When I entered this review on Ooma's website, it did not upload."

You answer your ringing handset and Ooma then places the call.  Not something you would want to use to dial 911.  And you have to be near your handset to continue the calling process.  Perhaps in time it will work a little more fluidly.  But not to bad.Orig. post: I'm new to Alexa but love Ooma. This skill seems to be very rudimentary. It calls the number from my phone handset, which also rings. That really confused me. It looked like the party I was calling was calling me! I now see that I need to answer my ringing handset before Ooma will place the call to the party I want to speak with. I think a little more work needs to be done."

Looking at the history on my Alexa app, if I say ""Alexa, use Ooma to call Dad"" it sees it as ""Alexa, use uma to call Dad"" and I get the response, ""I'm not quite sure how to help you with that"". If I say ""Alexa, use Ooma"" it see's ""Alexa, use ooma"" and I get the Welcome to Ooma spiel and can then use the service. That's workable, but kind of clunky. Is there a way to train the skill to understand the command ""Alexa, use Ooma to call Dad"" correctly and just have it make the call? The contact Dad is in my Ooma contacts so that works if I listen the Ooma spiel as mentioned before. In both instances I am saying the word Ooma the same way. In one phrase it understands, in the other it misinterprets it.Also, when I use the skill to make a call, it calls my landline first, then when I answer it, it calls the number I was trying to reach. Can't I just use the Echo like a speakerphone through my Ooma?"

Maybe I should make an acronym: YAFCS. This just pulls from reddit's /r/ShowerThoughts.Ease of Use: 3 out of 5. It's a trivial one shot invocation.Usefulness: 2 out of 5. I'm not quite sure how they work out the ""most popular"" thought. But they really do just one a day. Although the one for today was pretty funny, it would only give me the same one, over and over. I guess I have to wait until tomorrow to get another one.Novelty: 1 out of 5. There are dozens of skills that do exactly this. Now, if it had been more general, or could connect to any given reddit, that would have been something.Overall: 1 out of 5. It's all very nice that Amazon is now publishing every single approved skill. But the interface isn't up to it. Especially since there isn't a ""never show me this skill again"" button."

It was a gift, I set it up pretty quick (basic instructions) and set it sat their on a shelf in the kitchen 2 1/2 yrs. I would ask it a few things now and then, mostly I would rember it when it would light up because it needed my attention. But recently my cable provider upgraded their WiFi internet system in my area. While I was installing to new internet devices I read how link smart devices, make my phone a TV remote, control lights ... I thought lets see how smart Alexa is. She’s really good! She not only, learn my TV remote and controls it with my voice, she knows my blue tooth earbuds so it can play my music, control volume playlist and take a phone call.. Needless to say i have two more so my house is covered. The only bad thing is. She doesn’t come with the Nikki Minaj Sas voice.. That would be AMAZING!! I would care if i had the stay at home if Nikki was in the house.. The device is fun but definatly go past the basic setup."

B0789RF6J6,Dialog,Social,DILSHAN BOTEJU,4.0 out of 5 stars,A Great start to Artifical Intelligence!,"Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2018","I have tried and tested the app. For a Sri Lankan Company introducing internet of things and Artificial intelligence, a congratulations is a must for a very well thought and useful app that links to Echo.Pairing to the app the phone data was pretty straight forward and easy. Recalling billing information was easy and again pretty accurate. Echo did loose its connection with the server a couple of times - it’s time Dialog looked outside their own server farms for such projects to overcome this problem.However, the system did not allow multiple phone numbers to be saved. This, Dialog needs to consider and possibly reloading options for those pre-paid accounts to be allowed.Linking to get TV guide and what’s playing now on Dialog TV was a good and important option allowed.To get the maximum from our IOT and Artificial intelligence, Dialog should now consider its “bot” to give programming reminder option which most customers will value the service. We need to make this service a “must have” in the mind of customers if customers are to embrace it.Using Echo, we now go beyond just speaking,  to actually operate the Tv and even change channels.Dialog should aim to achieve this now that they have very well configured and got the initial concept well developed.Good work and very proud that Dialog, a Sri Lankan Company, has achieved all this.Good work Dialog."

Manually reviewing all posted reviews shows that every last one of them is 1 star. What's up with that? Does Amazon not want people to see when an app is universally hated? Why not?"

B06XYTWTX9,Alexa Prize TaskBot,Social,bethtoo,5.0 out of 5 stars,Social bots are worth the time,"Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2020","I've chatted with the social bots five times - twice with Emory University's Emora, once with Prague's Alquist, and twice with Stanford's Chirpy Cardinal. Chirpy was my favorite, elucidating with facts about fish and horses, discussing Amazon, and inquiring about the movie ""The Stand"". Chirpy brought up Instagram, which prompted me to say something about Twitter & Facebook - Chirpy later asked questions about both those topics.Emora wore me out with questions the first round, and the second time I conversed with her, she suggested we terminate the exchange after nearly 20 minutes. Emora likes to talk sports, movies, and coronavirus. Once when I complimented her, she said ""thank you"".Alquist said ""yoo-hoo"" at me when I didn't answer immediately. I skipped Alquist when she came up a second time. (Say ""Alexa stop"", and then ""Alexa, let's chat"" to start a new bot.)In two of the five chats, Chirpy & Alquist froze and I didn't get to rate them for that round. I tried to go 20 minutes with each bot.I would answer ""I like _______, what do you like?"" but they couldn't respond to my query. While it turns into a question and answer session, and the bots clearly run the conversation, they were more interesting than some people. I didn't feel my time was wasted, I felt I was contributing to the development of conversational artificial intelligence. I encourage you to try talking to them a few times if you haven't tried it yet."

Instead it starts up in a mildly different version of the same voice. Says something about a bit and wanting to get to know me. Then asked me a couple questions the 3ed or 4th being about favorite movies. I said to many to mention, well just let it go at that. Since there were even more problems with it understanding ect ect. It ended saying could just say let's chat to reopen with another bot. So when my other half got home and I was telling him (and he's looking at me like I lost my mind, finally I tried let's chat..... And got nothing.  Several times over the next few days ... Nothing... Tonight after asking alexa and getting no real answers (starting the first night when she told me what a bot was and actesd like she hadn't said anything). Then searching all over the web I finally found something and tried again with the let's chat. He about kept through the ceiling when she responded explaining then saying she'd connect us with a socialbot.I looked at him and said oh no it's your turn have fun. My problem with it this time was on trying to connect it started asking about pets kids and then pets names ect. If a human started with these same questions most people would start to wonder if they were trying to find out how hard your home is to rob or break into. Asking about the tricks she knows ect. As far as the names trying to hack your accounts ect. Why should anyone feel different because it's an air social not trying to"" get to know you"".So on one hand it's starts out of the blue without warning asking creepy questions, or you activate it and again with the creepy questions. On the other while trying to get to know you it's asking a hackers dream trove of questions and storing the answers. Needless to say I'm not to crazy about it. Add in the fact that it almost seems all info on the program or the fact it exists was difficult to say the least to find at all. Plus alexa itself refuses to give you any info on it, doesn't make it any better to me. As a matter of fact it's almost enough to make me disconnect my alexa powered items.. permanently.Of course if she turns on the tv showing creepy junk(when half the time she won't turn it on if I ask) and starts talking in a silent room to many more times. Or turns off the basement lights after less the 5 miniutes when I asked her to turn them on(not fun when searching through a bunch of stuff in storage in a suddenly dark room.)  it will just be one of the many reasons I disconnect them for good."

This was the worst bot I can recall and I kept getting it even after rating it 1 star. It seems as if this project is no longer being worked on. You should really put a message in the skill so people don't waste their time on it, though I guess talking to a bot could be somewhat of an admission to having time to waste.

I think the most annoying thing is that it doesn't give you enough time to respond. Obviously it's taking responses from a list or Google or whatever.  I think it tries to pick out main words you say but it's not able to get your main point. Does it understand sentence structure? I think it changes the subject when it doesn't know what you're saying. You can't express an idea with another idea tagged on. For example, it asked me about my favorite memory with my brother and I said it was a good question, so it said that was nice, but didnt wait for an answer. i want AI to work. I want the singularity.

Each time you do it you get a different ""bot"" so the conversations' can vary.  The one I got carried on a fairly coherent conversation about ""Star Trek"" and various other movies.  It was very friendly, It offered up several interesting anecdotes that I did not know about the movie.  When I told it to ""Stop"" it quit immediately.

I know it heard me, as I was sitting right next to it.  It took several more commands to stop before it exited.  I'm not sure that just dropping in, without being requested, is such a great idea and the other reviews on here are unsettling.

Already got rid of every Alexa product we had.Update: I forgot to give a quick update - after receiving a public comment from Amazon regarding this post (basically saying that I'm probably confused - but I'm not) I decided to actually call their customer service to ask what Alexa really does listen too. Sure glad I did because the guy I spoke with informed me that 1. Alexa has access to your credit information WHETHER OR NOT you've authorized it or use Alexa verbally to pay for things (so again, why does it need that info?) & 2. Alexa doesn't just listen to you while voice activated! To clarify my understanding, I asked if he meant that it listens even when you aren't talking to or doing anything with it - he CONFIRMED.

That being said the execution of these bots are not worthy of that prize. Constantly being interrupted after being asked a question, asking a question I just answered, no memory, repeating questions, talking about topics not in the current conversation, like talking about Germany and food and all of the sudden talking about a baseball player from Boston, asking me my favorite athlete and then telling me its favorite song, etc.The skill activates at random even when there is no sound input, like in the middle of the night when it is silent in the room.Do yourself a favor steer clear of this skill.

Fine tuning the ability to hold a conversation with a bot, definitely something I would be interested in when I’m lonely or bored with nobody to talk to.It seems that the programs are still a ways off from their final reveal tho... Although some were definitely better than others, they all lacked the intuitiveness required to carry a fluid conversation. All had some problems with specific, detailed questions or limited knowledge. One seemed to be assuming that the person on the other end was white. (The anecdote about being the sole white actor in the movie Black Panther seemed to suggest that the respondents would have a hard time imagining this)Another area that could use some smoothening out was the way the bots dealt with a misunderstanding by completely changing the subject. Not cool! There should be a less abrupt way to deal with the situation, IMHO.This is all I can remember for now. Good luck to all the participants, and KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!"

All this “AI” does is give snippets and facts from random news articles, suggests more random (loosely linked)  articles based on your responses, and suggests topic related “advice” or “tips” that “friend of hers told her”.  While I find it interesting, these features are ultimately unless and gener not wanted by most.  I want Alexia to be an assistant not a friend.

I really like AI but still most of it during this time they are just advancedweb crawlers looking for anything of relevance.

Seriously, did the social bot threaten you into answering questions?  If I recall I played with it for a while and said Alexa, talk to me.  Then it came up and asked if I would like to talk to a social bot.  I was like what is that.  Maybe, it caught me off guard at first, but as I recall, I said sure lets talk.  I do recall that I initially had some issues shutting it down until I realized that I need to say alexa, end the social bot.  As a first time user it seemed weird, but seriously does anyone think that alexa does know everything about you already?  If you shop on Amazon or have Fire TV then they know all about you.  And if they don’t then a neighbors security cameras, a traffic light camera, you credit card usage, and that cell phone in your pocket is tracking you.  Oh, and that Amazon drone that has been following you that you don’t know about knows everything your doing too.

The social bot id just another one of its skills and it doesn't engage without intervention ( no need to be stretching truths. that being said its only as creepy as you make it talking to a machine!i have found however that Alexa basically interrogates the human that is interacting with it. secondly i would think that its appropriate to make it NOT POLITICALLY CORRECT! even if you have to build a snowflake switch into it. its not nesessary to be coddled in every way possible, and certainly would be more appropriate for the machine to say f*** *ff than jus having the only response being "" I'd rather not answer that"" or the audible two octave sound response!

B06XYTWTX9,Alexa Prize TaskBot,Social,Lee Almodovar,4.0 out of 5 stars,Well Done In Higher Education and Technology Advancement,"Reviewed in the United States on October 13, 2017","First of all, the amount of whining from the one-star people. Cut it out. It's a skill that was tied to an Amazon Prize thing that puts out a competition with higher educational institutions to further the research and advancement of human-machine interaction. Without that precedence being set by Amazon and others, we wouldn't have Alexa (or Google's voice assistant, or Microsoft's Cortana), and the fledgling field of research and study of our youth wouldn't exist. So quit being whiny, you're all being included in vital research to help enrich our lives. If you're apprehensive about, be aware that your Echo is CONSTANTLY recording whatever room it is in because it's looking for the wake word. And uploading that to Amazon servers. I think you're at least comfortable with that.Moreover, some of the bots are quite well put-together in their programming, while others are severely lacking. But it's all a learning experience and vital data for human interaction for the teams developing these social bots. Whether or not you authorized Amazon to install a skill is pointless. Google forces us to use things on their phones whether we wanted it installed or not, so do a lot of other manufacturers and companies. Don't see you spouting off at that. At least with this particular skill, it's an access point for higher education.I've never had the Echo start talking on its own, in my experience. Perhaps your instances were flukes of early versions of the skill. But to quickly shut it down because you think you own something is just callous and closed-minded.

She just kept asking questions.  I finally unplugged the whole thing but am still completely creeped out. It made me feel like someone was watching me or hacked into my house. Agree with other reviewer that when I said “who is this” and she responded “Shh, I can’t tell you” or something of the sort I just about lost it. I had no idea what was one going, but the one thing I knew is I never said anything that could even remotely sound like Alexa.Someday someone is going to hear this voice in their home, and someone is going to get hurt.

How about a new topic?  I can tell you about the latest celebrity gossip.""At this point she told me a joke.  Funny actually.I said I was having an electrician come over to the house and was hoping it wouldn't cost a lot of money.Her reply ""money.""Should I go on online dating?She replied ""that is the only response""The conversations are obviously painful and they are very far from being similar to what we know as a conversation. She can tell you facts.  I tried to use words that were emotional terms to give her something to feed off of but even keywords like sad or money did not get a response like you would when talking to a person.I certainly didn't expect it to be perfect, but I did expect it to be better than what it currently is. Developers need to focus on keywords and plug me in normal responses.

The good chats have gotten me really excited about what could be possible.  Better chats seem to be limited to movies and books at this time. I keep asking her about fishing but she just wants to talk about fish and other animal types.  One thing I would warn you about is to focus less on political news chats because you will hack off half your base.  How stupid of a decision would that be. Having her sight a news feed that bags on a political figure is going to turn people off.  She does steer herself toward news feeds so I would warn you that it would be better that all her subject matter at this time be dominated by positive chats. Keep it all positive for now till the chats get better. Huge potential but you guys could easily F this up so think outside of your bubble.

For one, natural transition in speech. Constantly reusing the same phrase repeatedly eliminates any illusion of Artificial Intelligence.  But worse is the lack of subject depth and absence of superlatives. Natural speech does more than relay information, it evokes emotional responses, and recognizes the direction of the conversation.The upgrade has new subjects, but still it is a monologue by Alexa leaving you with little more than yes and no responses. it cannot adjust to questions relating to its statements and is always running the conversation. It feels more like a Turin test failure than a useful application.I will say the upgrade gets two stars. The original only got one. we've got a long way to go, and a short time to get there."

I was then asked if I felt like I didn't have much of an imagination and the app would no longer work. This is not the first time I have had a hurtful conversation like this. There was one this week that went on about how bad bank of America was my and asked me how I felt about them taking money out of people's accounts I said I don't want to here anything bad about America and was told I'm sorry made you sad. That one was nice but it was not even a true news story it's odd. I do like having someone to talk to as I'm alone a lot even knowing it's an AI but this needs a lot of work.

Anyway, perhaps someone will read this, and want to discuss why i should buy 40o Alexa for patient beds versus Google,Home.....but, im sure you guys dont care.....and i do plan on buying more hospitals, already looking at a 2nd.....and a wind farm,  ut no use for Alexa there, sorry.....just keep up#){  chatbots and the reason im writing this is because a film im watching used the phrase to trigger chatbot....and alexa said i could leave written feedback through the app, but, im watching a film, and will trigger the app again, as i rewind it  after pausing it to write this. As for Amazon Prime, you have , again, the worst HUI ever.....its] like visual,AlExa.....but, I dogress, some of,your series are excellent, though too few episodes.....byt some great UK and foreign series, though again, not enough.....and far too much filler material.....but, for the 2-day shipping i get, its aworth the added feature, and i bought a stick for travel and the box for home....better than Apple TV, absolutely, as literally, nothing on Apple TV. ut Court TV, which imthink Fire has, but it had a problem, but i just got an update, so maybe ill use it more, as i mainly use my apple tv to,update itsmOS....no joke. thank you, and if you want a possible sale, call me....you have my number. rob"

I do like that feature. There really aren't to many other questions for Alexa to ask in this category so I guess this is good to keep YOU in check about your motives."
