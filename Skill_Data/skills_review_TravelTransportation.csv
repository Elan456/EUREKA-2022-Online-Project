B07L3T5KH6,CTABot,Travel & Transportation,Paul,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works. A bit picky about syntax.,"Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2020","The skill works, and requires no setup. It is a bit picky abut the syntax, but the author discloses that. You can't ask by bus number. You have to ask at cross-street  and direction. For example, ""Alexa, Ask CTA Bot when the next bus at Ashland and Diversey, Westbound, is.""  It' sa bit of a mouthful. Or, you can just say, ""Alexa, open CTA Bot."" and it will give you instructions on syntax and wait for your input. Not sure how well it works if there are multiple buses. I imagine that downtown or on Michigan Ave. during rush hour it will rattle off a long list of buses and times."
B07L3T5KH6,CTABot,Travel & Transportation,MariaLSmith,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easiest CTA tracker to use,"Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2018","This skill is accurate and easy to use. Occasionally, it can be tricky to find the right phrasing for your stop but once you know what to ask you can get arrival times quickly."
B07L26165L,Flight Service,Travel & Transportation,Mooniac,4.0 out of 5 stars,"overall great, but some details still need work","Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2019","I don't have a lot of experience with it yet, but I can already mention two positives and one negative. I was quite impressed that the updates came faster than on aviationweather.gov. The metar KEWR 171451Z came through alexa maybe two minutes after it was issued. On aviationweather.gov it took 20 minutes. I was also thoroughly impressed that details in the remarks section came in full and correct, for example 58016 came correctly as ""three-hour atmospheric pressure steady or increasing, then decreasing; or decreasing then decreasing more rapidly"". As a negative I mention that it understands letters better than through the phonetic alphabet. For example ee yu ar was understood all the time, but echo whiskey romeo only in half of my test calls. Documentation says we should use the phonetic alphabet."

Say ‚ÄúMETAR at kilo Lima victor india‚Äù and it says ‚ÄúSorry, that‚Äôs not a valid ICAO airport code‚Äù.  I got it to work - once - with ‚Äúkilo LYMA victor India‚Äù.  I tried one letter at a time saying ‚ÄúMETAR at Leema‚Äù and it says ‚ÄúI heard LYMA‚Äù.I tried ‚ÄúKilo whiskey victor India‚Äù.

B07L26165L,Flight Service,Travel & Transportation,NORCAL_AV8OR,2.0 out of 5 stars,The volume is way too low,"Reviewed in the United States on August 16, 2019","The volume does not change with echo volume. It does not use the normal Alexa voice - it uses a soft, deep mail voice.  It is unintelligible and does not compare to the 'Airport Weather' skill I have used for years.  Needs some serious work."
B07L26165L,Flight Service,Travel & Transportation,Claudio Friederich,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Useful, but","Reviewed in the United States on October 4, 2020","The skill does not use the voice settings of the device. My volume is a comfortable level, and the default Alexa lady voice. But this skill talks in a male voice so quiet it is barely audible.  This is a real encumberance for this skill‚Äôs usefullness."

B01FROAWB0,Washington State Ferry,Travel & Transportation,Ama,5.0 out of 5 stars,pretty good,"Reviewed in the United States on July 3, 2016",Pretty good app. It uses the Washington state ferry keywords so it's easy to remember unlike that other ferry 'skill'.
B01FROAWB0,Washington State Ferry,Travel & Transportation,Torjer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great for most ferry routes,"Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2020","Lets you know the next ferry, the ferry after that, or the last ferry. Unfortunately can't tell you the closest ferry to a time that you specify, but otherwise is a helpful alternative to pulling out your phone and looking at the WSDOT app."
B01FROAWB0,Washington State Ferry,Travel & Transportation,Christopher Thomas,3.0 out of 5 stars,can't tell you general schedule info,"Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2018","It is ok at telling you the next 2 ferries, or the last ferry, but not the next 3 (""what are the next 3 ferries?""), or any other times (""when is the ferry after 6pm?"").  This makes it less useful for planning ahead.  The skill also makes you open it by its (rather long) name, rather than just ask alexa naturally."

App works just as supposed. Just wishing developer finds out time later on to have home stop setting stored, so you could only ask ""Alexa, ask blue white for next bus"" and get your own stop. Luckily for me default stop is previous one from my ;)"
B07LC71T6H,Snowbasin Mountain Report,Travel & Transportation,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,So fun and easy!,"Reviewed in the United States on April 7, 2019",Love this feature!

B0758TH8KC,Avis,Travel & Transportation,DB,1.0 out of 5 stars,Reservation quote was $152 higher than same reservation on avis.com,"Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2019","I was able to bring up the skill very easily. It asked for my city, rental start date and time, rental end date (but not time - annoying), and then said I could reserve an intermediate car for about $440. Mind you, I had the Avis website up at the same time on my computer, and through the Avis website saw that booking through the website with the exact same parameters would cost about $288 (taxes/fees included). Why does a reservation through the skill cost $152 more? Based on this experience, I will not use the skill again and would highly encourage anyone using it to make sure it is not more than what you can get on the Avis website."
B0758TH8KC,Avis,Travel & Transportation,Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Promotion has fine print,"Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2018",Beware I did not get my gift card.  I was told since they offered me a free upgrade it disqualified me.
B0758TH8KC,Avis,Travel & Transportation,The Baz,1.0 out of 5 stars,Double the online rate,"Reviewed in the United States on May 7, 2019","The skill worked okay. It had trouble finding the pickup location I wanted to, given the number of options in my city. But somehow instead of continuing to give options IN the city, it jumped to locations 15 miles outside the city. And sometimes repeated them. Despite that, I was able to give it enough of a guide (e.g., the location address) that after a couple attempts it ""found"" my pickup spot.But then, after completing the process, it offered a rental rate more than double the online rate.No thank you."
B0758TH8KC,Avis,Travel & Transportation,Charles,1.0 out of 5 stars,Great if you don't care about price or most details,"Reviewed in the United States on June 28, 2019","This app epitomizes what is wrong with coding at this time.  Having a product is more important than whether the product is actually well-thought out or if it really works.  So little attention has apparently been paid to the user interface and what a real customer needs that it should be embarrassing.What if you're in a household with more than 1 person who travels and needs rental cars?  Didn't make it to the actual point of finalizing a reservation, so, maybe there's a spot in there that allows a renter change, but since it is accessing the Avis profile linked to the Alexa, I'm betting not. Guessing the only way to book for the wife is to link her Avis account to Alexa to make the reservation and then I guess unlink and relink to mine to do one for me.Unanticipated response from user cancels the entire reservation process, but the response shouldn't be unanticipated.  When Alexa asks ""when do you want to return it?"" it is apparently only wanting the date of the return because apparently return time isn't an option. Mentioning time throws the error message and closes the skill.  If you want just the date, then ask ""what day do you want to return it?""  See how easy that is?  That's what I mean by awful needs assessment for the scripting.And why is return time not an option?  If you pick it up at 10 am, it's going to reserve it until 10 am on drop-off day.  What if I'm not back to the airport until 4 that afternoon?  Who really reserves in 24-hour increments on a regular basis?No option for drop-off at a different location.Accuracy of rental location:  I said ""Baltimore Washington Airport,"" Alexa replied with ""did you mean 101 w Fayette st Baltimore MD 21201?""  ""Uh, yeah, I guess"" while I typed the address in and found out that the address is the Radisson Hotel Baltimore Downtown-Inner Harbor.  What?  How did we go from Baltimore Washington Airport to a hotel with only one of those words in its title?And finally pricing.  Booking through Alexa doesn't offer an option to prepay for the reservation and the actual price was different by a few dollars than the price that I could see online for the ""at the counter"" reservation.  No clue why.  Not sure if the Alexa price was better or if it was worse but sounded a couple of bucks lower because it wasn't telling me the price with taxes which is what I'm guessing probably was the case.Not anywhere near ready for primetime.  Basic needs have not been anticipated in any way.Don't bother with the Budget skill either because it's the same as this one, just linking to the Avis partner instead."
B0758TH8KC,Avis,Travel & Transportation,PFG,1.0 out of 5 stars,Unusable,"Reviewed in the United States on May 9, 2019","Tried to use it for upcoming rental. First when it came up Alexa was suggesting airports instead of asking where I wanted  Brunei? Deery?  After 5 suggestions ‚Äúshe‚Äù finally asked where I wanted to go.  She won‚Äôt respond to just a date, you have to give day of the week, month and date.  Also you can‚Äôt choose what car you want - you are only offered an intermediate car.  Was hoping to try it and get the 20% back but this app makes that impossible.  That was what made this a better deal than elsewhere, so I will go elsewhere."
B0758TH8KC,Avis,Travel & Transportation,Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Free upgrades eliminate the benefit,"Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2019","I travel extensively for work, and unfortunately my company always uses Avis.  I was very happy when I found out about this Amazon perk, so at least I'm getting something to offset the terrible customer service from Avis.  I got about six gift cards in the first 2-3 months, then they just stopped giving them to me.  When I called Avis (today) they said I didn't qualify for the gift cards because I was upgraded.  First, I never requested an upgrade, the give it to me EVERY TIME because of my status with the Avis program.  Second, I am 100% sure that the rentals for which I did get the gift cards included a free upgrade.So... I guess someone found a loophole and ended the perk for people who travel a lot.  But if you do travel a lot and use Avis, this is just more annoying technicality of dealing with them.  It was fun while it lasted."
B0758TH8KC,Avis,Travel & Transportation,KL,1.0 out of 5 stars,NEVER EVER USE THIS COMPANY,"Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2020","After waiting on a 20 minute line we were told our car wouldn‚Äôt be ready for another 20 minutes, and this is because Avis company over booked. After 45 minutes, NOT 20, we finally got to our car.We realize that there is a broken tail light on our car, which is also not the vehicle we asked for, so we asked one of the Avis employees. She told us‚Äù it is fine, when you drive up to leave, just tell them it was the person before you who had left it in that condition‚Äù. So we packed our car and put in the car seat the company provided us.We then drive up to hand in our info and leave, but, the employee at the window told us, ‚Äú if the car has that broken on it, you‚Äôll have to get another car. My husband asked him to call and tell them he needed to speak to a supervisor.The supervisor didn‚Äôt show up for 15 mins, and he takes 90$ off ...WHICH ISNT EVEN HALF OF WHAT WE PAID FOR THIS SERVICE!Then, we finally get another car, an suv this time,( like we asked for from the beginning) and an avis employee parks it not in a parking spot, oh no, but I the middle of isle. So now everyone is trying to get around as we trying to pack our SECOND car.The car seat isn‚Äôt fitting, another supervisor comes over and he ACCUSES ME of putting the wrong safety strap on the car seat. He said ‚Äú This isn‚Äôt the right part for this car seat is this yours?‚ÄùSo now to add to the lllooonnnggg list of things,this company doesn‚Äôt even provide the proper safety strap for a car seat!Finally after TWO AND A HALF HOURS we leave.When we came to return the car to the airport we had to wait on a FIFTY MINUTE line, we almost missed our flight, we had to run with a 4 year old to catch it on time.Oh and they tried to charge us for not filling the gas tank, which we filled right before dropping it off.What a SUPER CRAP company!"
B0758TH8KC,Avis,Travel & Transportation,Francis Esmonde-White,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Experience was not worthwhile, but cool concept.","Reviewed in the United States on July 24, 2018","It didn't work at all with my Alexa home thermostat.I was able to use it with the alexa app on my cell phone (only by saying alexa, rent a car from avis). I couldn't select the car type (intermediate is what was quoted), and the quote came back way above what I saw when booking directly. This is no good.The interface itself was good, but it didn't allow me to modify my reservation details (like the car size). This is clearly a couple of years of R&D from prime-time readiness."

B0758TH8KC,Avis,Travel & Transportation,ktshirley,1.0 out of 5 stars,Does not list all locations,"Reviewed in the United States on May 6, 2019","I tried to book a reservation in Seattle. I wanted the 5th Avenue location because it is across from the hotel I am staying in. Alrxa did not list this location; consequently, I couldn't take advantage of the promotion being offered by Amazon, a 20 percent coupon.  Amazon said the developer has not completed the list of locations for Avis. I would not use this Alexa booking unless Alexaa has the location. Developer needs to do more work ."
B0758TH8KC,Avis,Travel & Transportation,Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Questionable Tactics at Avis Rome Airport,"Reviewed in the United States on October 11, 2019","We had a very unfortunate experience with Avis in Italy. The agents at the Rome airport told us we were getting a ""special offer"" which turned out to be a sly manipulation into an upgrade. We relied on the agent to explain our contract to us in English since it was written in Italian. She assured us that due to this special promotion we would be getting a better car for less money than the car we had originally reserved. Instead - we were ultimately hit with a bill for over three times the amount of our original reservation. Our calls to Avis Car Rental about this matter have been met with rudeness and condescension despite the fact that reviews on Yelp and TripAdvisor forums show that this kind of deception happens again and again at Avis Rome Airport. The folks at @avis claim we should have known better and we should have asked for a contract in English. Not a very good excuse for their agents' questionable tactics for selling upgrades. For shame Avis."
B0758TH8KC,Avis,Travel & Transportation,John Marshall,1.0 out of 5 stars,VERY poor experience with this company,"Reviewed in the United States on March 24, 2020","Last November, I rented an Avis car at Sky Harbor Airport in Phoenix.  Less than a half hour after leaving the airport location I had a flat tire directly in front of an auto repair shop.  I immediately turned into the parking lot and asked if I could pay someone to change the tire for me. A manager told me would be happy to change the tire but wouldn‚Äôt think of charging me for it.Upon opening the trunk, we discovered that there was no spare tire which was the first issue. So, he brought out an air compressor to get enough air in the tire so that I could slowly drive to a satellite Avis location less than a quarter mile away. It quickly became apparent that the tire was not holding the air. In trying to determine why, he noticed that there was a large hole in the interior portion of the wheel. So, all the air being pumped into the tire was immediately coming out of the hole. Given the location of the hole it was obviously a defective wheel and not something I had done.The nearby Avis location exchanged the car which made me happy until four months later when I received a repair bill for $677.44 for damages that I did NOT cause.  Now I am decidedly UNhappy and will NEVER rent from this company again."

Paz,1.0 out of 5 stars,This skill is not ready for use.,"Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2018","It took forever to get Alexa to understand generally what I was asking for, and when I finally was able to make a car reservation, there was not option to select the car type or modify preferences other than date and location."

B0758TH8KC,Avis,Travel & Transportation,Tracey,1.0 out of 5 stars,skill needs updating,"Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2019",I am trying to use the Avis Alexa skill to get the gift card.  I am trying to reserve at a non airport location with limited hours.  It asks for the time for pick up but defaults to a time when the location is closed (not when I want to return the vehicle) so it won't let me make the reservation.

Avis doesn't even show up in the skills section for Alexa on  an S9+, Note 8 or desktop computer. I was to trying to enable to receive the promo 20% cash back for booking through Alexa. This was a dud and an hour I""ll never get back. It's sad the call center reps aren't even equipped to know/figure out what the issue. I finally found the enable button on my desktop website and it does nothing when clicked 20x. I'd try 20 more but that'd be textbook insanity. While the perk is great, the hassle isn't worth the time. I downloaded Alexa solely for this reason so it will be uninstalled."

B0758TH8KC,Avis,Travel & Transportation,Kevin B,1.0 out of 5 stars,No flexability and hard to use,"Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2018","Great concept, poor execution.  Hard to get the reservation started, have to run down a list of rental locations with ""no"" ""no"" and eventually ""yes"".  Doesn't have any flexibility to change car type from your preference, add coverage etc.  Often books a car different from your preference.  I use it for the 20% gift card but it takes me three or four times as long than using the website."
B0758TH8KC,Avis,Travel & Transportation,Steven,1.0 out of 5 stars,Avis sucks,"Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2020",Absolutely lousy deceptive pricing and fees if you need to extend or use lost and found or report a maintenance issue you get an obviously outsourced call center with the worst customer service possible. Then you go on a phone loop being transferred all over the place and back to the automated system. The airport doesn't answer their phone. If you want to have a stress free experience when being a good customer and adding WEEKS to your reservation do not use avis. Also the app is pure trash it doesn‚Äôt function or update information. If you have a choice on where to rent and value American jobs steer clear of avis. Still no amazon incentive

B06VYJDJ3C,Unofficial Path Train Guide,Travel & Transportation,Shannon D,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good start! a couple of caveats,"Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2017","It understands me well and seems to be accurate. However, you must suss out what station names it's looking for, and will continue to pester you that either the origin or destination location is missing. For example, it doesn't know ""Newark Penn Station"", only ""Newark"", even though it calls the station ""Newark Penn Station"" when it repeats back to you.If you get stuck in the origin/destination missing pester loop, the safe-word is ""quit"".Also, it doesn't restrict itself to PATH. If you ask for the next train from Newark to 33rd Street, it'll put you on Amtrak. That will get you there, but WAY more expensively than taking the WTC train out of Newark and then transferring to the 33rd St PATH.A nice enhancement would be to hear the next -n- departures from a particular station. But all in all, bearing in mind the limitations, it's handy."

That is where it ends. It pretty much only gives me three choices and not one of them is initially to get a ride. You would think that would be an initial choice being a ride share service. You first have to ask it to find the nearest driver. Only then does it give you the option to ""Order a lyft."" You would think the next thing would be Alexa asking something along the lines of where to or to what destination are you going? Nope. You have to open your phone's app to add that. It won't even let me check to see how far away my driver is? It would be nice to know when they are two minutes away or when they arrived via my alexa...aka the way I ordered my ride. They need to add the most basic functions the app has to this skill."

The target user is my wife, who has no computer or computer skills and has had to resort to GoGoGrandma phone calls to get a Lyft sometimes.  I'm an engineer and have set this all up for her, but can't be around to babysit.  It should give better feedback and fuller information, as another comment noted.

B01FV34BGE,Lyft,Travel & Transportation,Lauren,5.0 out of 5 stars,Can't link account in app? Use Alexa skills section on amazon.com,"Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2017","*Review of functionality of app belowIn app seemed to be giving me similar problems that others have stated having: not getting verification text promptly, and unable to get beyond giving my cc info (error message of ""unexpected error"" would pop up and that would be the end of it). I use Lyft to get to work constantly as I am always on call, usually only get about an hour's notice, and live close enough that it's not a huge expense to use it to at least get to work so I'm not sweaty and wind blown by the time I get there. So needless to say I wasn't opposed to doing a little detective work to get it to work, scrolled down through the comments until I finally found someone who, instead of belittling those who could not figure out how to link their account and therefore gave a bad review, actually gave a useful solution.Got out the laptop, amazon.com, departments drop down, Echo & Alexa, Alexa skills, search Lyft, link account. At this point you will have to allow the pop up that amazon is going to want to open as the ""sign in to Lyft"" page, so if you have an adblocker, you should get a little notification when you click ""link account"", which will give you the option to allow it. But I mean, if you had the wherewithal to install an adblocker, I'd imagine you'd already be privy to how to temporarily disable it/allow a one time pop up window. After that, it's just like how it wanted to work in the app, send verification text, give cc info, hit accept, account linked!*As to how well the function actually works, I tried it out and I'm as pleased as could be. I asked, ""Alexa, I need a ride from Lyft"" (you have to specify Lyft as those dirty b*stards at Uber cornered the ""I need a ride"" phrase for their app), and she informed how far away in minutes the closest driver was to my location, then asked if I'd like her to call it for me. If yes, she'll play a bit of music (seems to change every time) until you're paired. It seems that at this point the music will stop, at which point I usually get a text from the Lyft app about my driver, but Alexa will also ask if I'd like to know if the app has successfully paired me with anyone so I don't have to worry about checking it on my phone. If you say yes, she'll give you the appropriate info about the driver like name, type of car, and eta (basically the information that you get via text from Lyft). Definitely great for me when I'm scrambling to get my sh*t together, get it all together, and put it in a backpack. All my sh*t, so it's all together."

Linked to my existing account, so assume that shortcoming has been addressed.After that, it has worked perfectly. :)Update: Today it forgot that I had my home and work ""shortcuts"" set up in the app. I re-added them and am hoping it will work tomorrow. Cannot summon a ""Line"" ride without those set up.Update: No dice. Still thinks I have no home and work addresses configured. Trying the usual disable and re-enable Skill ""fix"" that most of these things seem to require from time to time...Update: Still fails, even after disabling and re-enabling the Skill. Insists I have not set up my ""shortcuts"", though I edited and re-saved them. Changing to one star as it is now unusable (at least for Lyft Line).Support asked me to (surprise) try updating the app. Did not help. Repeated all above steps as well. Same nonsense message at every turn. Useless Skill now.Update: They finally fixed it and it worked for exactly one day. Now every time I request a ride it states: ""I'm unable to process your request"". After informing support of this, they told me I should update my Android OS, which makes no sense as the app itself continues to update successfully (twice in last week) and works fine on my older OS."

Second, for some reason the skill hangs on to focus after telling me about the bus, so anything I say gets interpreted as an attempt to get more bus information. I just want to hear how long until my bus comes, then that's it.So it works, but I'd prefer it if it were simpler and faster.Update: And it only remembers your settings at once device.

But, I would ask Dave to please add Maine's two main airports: Portland International Jetport (KPWM - not to be confused with Portland International Airport in Oregon!!!), and Bangor International Jetport (KBGR). If author can add these, as well as one more.... in New Hampshire, would be nice to have KPSM added (Portsmouth International Airport).  I'll up my rating to 5 stars if these airports could be added. Also, need to be sure that Alexa allows verbal syntax for Portland, Maine.... as in: ""Alexa, ask Airport Weather to get Portland, MAINE"". That's the only way to differentiate between Maine and Oregon."

For example ""Alexa, ask Airport Weather for the forecast for Kilo Bravo Foxtrot India,"" will tell you that it can't find the TAF, and the return speech will have the initial ""kilo"" doubled.  So somewhere there is a bug in this skill.That said, I found the functionality overall very clean, and as a CFI myself who is rushing out the door in the mornings to fly with students, it's nice to be able to hear the TAF and METAR read off to me while brushing teeth, getting dressed, etc.A few bug fixes, a little more QA, and this could be perfect... it certainly earned a place in the skills I will keep running (and since it's unnecessary, I quit writing my own, although it's an interesting intellectual exercise...)"

B0184JBP4I,DC Metro,Travel & Transportation,Schaq,3.0 out of 5 stars,Great concept but inconsistent and too verbose,"Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2015","Very useful for asking for next trains arriving at non-transfer stations. But it can't handle transfer stations. For example, it gives only Red Line train info for both Metro Center and Gallery Place, and it doesn't give any train info for L'Enfant Plaza station. It does, however, support multi-line stations that share the same tracks, e.g., it'll give times for both Green and Yellow line trains at Columbia Heights, Orange, Silver and Blue at Foggy Bottom, and Blue and Yellow at Pentagon.Several other behaviors make it not user-friendly. It won't recognize questions if you don't use exactly the right words in exactly the right order (I'm not referring to the trigger phrase, ""Alexa, ask DC Metro...,"" which is required to invoke this skill). It doesn't allow you to specify particular lines or destinations, so at stations like Foggy Bottom you must listen to times for trains in both directions on all three lines (six total). By the time it gets to the third line it would have been faster to check the times on a smartphone, especially because the results are delivered in unnecessarily repetitive complete sentences. For example:ALEXA:  ""For station Crystal City, on the Blue line towards Largo Town Center, a train is arriving in 8 minutes. On the Blue Line towards Franconia-Springfield, trains are arriving in 3, 7, and 13 minutes. On the Yellow line towards Mt. Vernon Sq....""Concise answers would be much more useful.

B07C3YW8N8,Travel Bucket,Travel & Transportation,Voice Spark!,3.0 out of 5 stars,Could be so much more!,"Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2018","Travel bucket has a lot of potential, but falls short of being mediocre. The problem is at most this skill is just a fact skill randomly picking out places you should visit.  There is no clear direction on how to save a place to your bucket list in skill and this only occurs after it reads off a long-winded location to visit. I believe that the user should be able to add a location anytime that they wanted and to be able to add places outside of the locations provided in the Skill. Several times I attempted to access locations that were not in the skill, but it just kept giving me a place that I didn‚Äôt want to visit. I would have liked to have had this Skill produce reasons way I should visit a location when I requested a certain location, not just a random one. As a user I want to be in control. There is also a series of card templates that a developer could use in order to create a visual experience. Overall, I think this skill could be something, but it needs a lot of work in order to create a useful experience."

I save pretty frequently, as you never know when you are going to lose data because the power goes out. I am able to update the information from home now, even though the echos are at the beach.Another great bonus is that if a guest owns a smart phone, they can download google assistant, and get all of the information on the phone.This will be a great addition for our rentals I would highly encourage everyone to do this."

Since the first day I received an Echo as a gift, I was delighted.  Beyond all the cool voice activated capabilities, I was immediately intrigued with the idea of also equipping our Vacation Rental Home with Alexa.  It can clearly be a huge differentiator in our guests' experiences in renting our home.  The skill provides a way to skip all the pain-staking programming and focus on the content we want to provide to our guests - Welcome message, home system instructions, local sights and recommendations, etc...The travel industry has rightfully turned to selling ""experiences"" and the VR Concierge Service really enables us to up our game on the experience Vacation Rental guests receive at our property.

Clearly a labor of love.  Myself, I fell in love with the concept and decided to give it a spin. I spent 3 hours typing all the answers to set up the app.  Features of the home. Details about wifi, entertainment system, nearby attractions, things to do, directions and recommendations to beaches, etc etc.You name it and I provided it.You do that by selecting one of several ""topics"" then adding categories and descriptions.At the very end I decided to eliminate (delete) the very last description. I decided I didn't need to add it.  I was horrified when the screen blinked and displayed only the background picture of an echo device.Yes everything I had typed. Everything. In every section. In every category. Every topic. Gone.Clearly the button doesn't do what it's supposed to. That's a bug but it's ok. But it doesn't save at all as you go on?Part of the process is that you select major topics at a time: residence, restaurants, etc. I didn't notice the save button until the screen went blank. But how can it. It save It not save at all? Not even at the end of a topic?Anyway needlessly to say haven't been able to use it at all.I really want to like this. I own 5 homes throughout the country. I have placed the new echo plus in all of them. I'm only here for 2 days on this one."

During setup, I had a small issue around one of the menu words not being recognized, so I contacted the developers and they responded and fixed the issue in less than 24 hours. I was VERY impressed with their responsiveness. As far as the Skill itself, it works very well. The menus are easy to navigate, setup was a cinch, updating the Management Portal is easy (and it auto-saves now, which I saw was an issue people used to have - so that‚Äôs been fixed!), and the trial runs have been flawless.
