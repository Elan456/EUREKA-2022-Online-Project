He had a rental property that was giving him issues and told me Donnie got him top dollar and did it fast. I was having person issues in a relationship I was in and figured it would be easier to sell the house than go through a eviction process. My property had a nice home on a terrible lot. Donnie met with me went over a detailed plan to get top dollar for my house quickly. He told me what I needed to do to get my house ready for sale and how he was going to market it. I had my end of the bargain done in a week. He listed my home and had a open house that first weekend and had ‚Äúglamor shots‚Äù of my house done. I cannot over emphasis how bad my lot was. Zero lot lines and a two level backyard. This was a challenge. Donnie had my house sold within 3 weeks and got why I felt was top of the mark considering the poor lot. I highly recommend him. He is not a realtor to list your house on MLS and wait for a offer he is proactive, professional and has a plan. Highly recommend.Rob Bailes"

I enabled and disabled about 10 space news skills before finding this one.  It really had news not just headlines and stuff I didn't know.  I really wanted to know what companies and government's were doing in space.  I really wanted to know about the race to the Moon and who was doing what.  This skill was obviously written by a paeson and did not just give a teaser with no information.  It told about China landing on the dark side of the moon but didn't stop there.  It listed the instruments which us techs know what could be done and also gave the non-techs objectives in the biological world like the probe took seeds to plant to see if we can grow things with lunar soil.  It said more in a very quick space of time which is harder than you would think.  I actually wish it went further in deapth but realice that this is a flash breafing.  Giving this criteria I wish it told me where to go (Podcast or web) to ge more info.  I hope that this brief doesn't say this same things every day (not updated) which I have run into but if it changes every few days I will be satisfied.  I can always say, ""Next"" to skip to my newt flash briefing."

We met with him and told him what we were looking for in a home.  We were not expecting to find a house meeting our requirements in a short time but within a month Mike found the exact house.  He worked with the seller to negotiate the price, the purchase of some of the fixtures, paintings and yard furniture.  He then moved forward with the purchase with very little work required by us.

We knew we needed to make a change, especially when we started looking in the Valencia area. Mike Hrezo was that change. Scratch that. He was a relief. He instantly understood not only what we were looking for as far as location and budget, but he understood US. Our personalities, our preferences, our dreams. He was upbeat and very professional during the entire process and when we thought we had found our dream home (and then lost it), Mike didn't let us down. He found our real home, the home we live in now, and was a teammate throughout it all.Looking for a home can be very frustrating, sometimes even heartbreaking, but Mike became a true friend in the process, keeping our best interests at the top. If you're looking for a home in the Santa Clarita Valley, Mike Hrezo is your guy."
B07MVX1LZV,Mike Hrezo - Valencia Real Estate,Business & Finance,Scott,1.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointing experience,"Reviewed in the United States on June 23, 2020","My ex chose Mike to help us sell our home. He showed it frequently, and eventually found a buyer. However, he seemed to change his approach when he realized that I chose a separate realtor to help me with my home purchase. From the signed purchase agreement, til closing, he was not communicating in ways that represented the best interests of both of us.  He created and ‚Äúagreement‚Äù between my ex and the buyer for her to ‚Äúrent‚Äù the property for a few weeks after closing. He did not communicate this with me or the escrow company, and presumed that I would be willing to pay the ‚Äúrent‚Äù of my ex. Instead of attempting to resolve the admitted mistake, he pointed fingers of blame at the escrow company and myself.  He was slow to respond to questions able repairs and closing specifics, but was quick to relay text messages from my ex, that had nothing to do with the sale of the house.  When I told him to NOT respond or relay these type of messages, he refused.  I was very disappointed in his change after finding out I chose someone else for my purchase.#pettiness"

He was always available to us, spending as much time as needed to answer any questions and to help with any hiccups along the way. In addition to finding us our new home, he also sold our home at the time, and managed any hiccups that happened with patience, confidence, and professionalism. Not only is he invaluable as far as his connections and experience go, but his commitment and dedication to finding the perfect house for us was apparent. Even other things that first-time homebuyers might not know, Mike was there to help with, as far as excellent referrals for repairs or remodels, or questions as to where any 'valve thingy' might be located in the house. We were able to purchase our dream home thanks to Mike and his ability to get us in to make an offer before the house even hit the market. But like other reviews here state, he really does care. He's easy to talk to, extremely knowledgeable, and a great agent. We are loving our home and still pinch ourselves! And we also now know where the valve thingy is."

What it needs for the next step is the following capability:Alexa, ask Acumatica to provide most critical item stock status.Item XYZ has quantity of 10.  Based on sales orders, existing POs, and forecast based on prior period, I recommend PO order for quantity of 1000.  Would you like me to create a purchase order for that quantity with preferred vendor.Yes, create PO.Alexa then creates the purchase order.Since Alexa is now available within prescription glass frames (Alexa Frames), this would allow staff hands-free capability while walking around a warehouse, mfg shop floor, or even while walking outside on a construction job site.This same concept could be extended to manufacturing operations steps to record labor and raw materials in the manufacturing process without having to key into a laptop or enter in the mobile app."

B07MTTKQNF,Comcast Business,Business & Finance,Alberto Olivera Jr,5.0 out of 5 stars,Make's life so much easier,"Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2019","Alexa works great in our main conference room.I hate the old way with our previous provider where you had to look up the phone number, enter the conference id, and then enter in the leader/moderator pin.  Alexa turns on the speaker phone and signs me in automatically.  No more waiting 5 minutes just to get logged in.  Their Comcast Business Companion App also makes this process much easier.Jeremy over at Comcast Business was also very helpful with the instructions he sent us and following up if we had any issues.  The instructions were clear and step-by-step that anyone can figure it out.  He asked for genuine feedback and ways they can make our life easier.  Look forward in seeing how Alexa and Comcast Business can evolve together.Comcast Business (BVE) has provided us with many useful ways to speed up and assist with calls.  It's so easy to work remotely due to power loss, bad weather, or any other incident.  We can keep track with Skype if people are working and on call.  We can call people from Skype.  We also have the ability to call via chrome, so when we google a number we can click and be on the phone.  This plus so much more.  Being the IT manager and rolling out new technology you generally get some push back when trying new things, but I have been fortunate enough that its so easy and people see the value right away."
B07MTTKQNF,Comcast Business,Business & Finance,Matt Davis,5.0 out of 5 stars,Little differences for a much better work life,"Reviewed in the United States on March 11, 2020","I have been using the Alexa control for Comcast BVE in our Conference Room and my office for the past few weeks and have found some excellent surprises in adding each to those locations.First was setting up the system; after trialing other Alexa Room Control solutions that forced me to spool up AWS services and never fully worked I was weary. I was very surprised at how easy they make getting the Alexa side of things connected, really a click of 2 buttons in the end.As a Pro A/V company our Conference Room serves the dual purpose of being a meeting space while also being a sales demonstration arena. The Alexa control is not only easy when starting a meeting to scheduling one but has caught the interest of many visitors to the room. I think as this continues to grow it will become a meeting room staple for most organizations.The larger surprise was using the Alexa service in my office... I have found little to be more satisfying then asking Alexa to turn on ""Do Not Disturb"" as I exit the office for the day. I realized it is the small ways it allows me to schedule and set my phone statuses as needed without having to punch in key codes or fumble through a menu.Overall I would highly recommend, if you have the option, taking the Comcast BVE Alexa Skill for a spin; I think you'll be pleasantly surprised by the small ways it makes life easier."

Faith and her team do not miss a single detail and got the house sold quickly, despite the pandemic and riots!  We chose Faith after reading reviews, and the first time we met her we knew we were in good hands.  She and her team are very communicative and proactive.  We highly recommend Faith and Team!  They are completely honest, trustworthy and transparent about every step of the selling process.

Faith fights for you.,"Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2019","When my wife and I decided it was time to sell our home we were fortunate to find Faith Harmer.  We asked Faith to look at our home and suggest things we could or should do to best prepare the house to sell at a good price.Faith shared her thoughts and we  took her advice.  When we asked if she knew people who could be trusted to do good work for us at a reasonable price she graciously provided a list of people she had used in the past.  Their work confirmed that they were people who did good work at a fair price.When we felt the house was ready to be listed Faith arranged photographs and a video tour of the house.  Both were amazing.In a market that was growing tougher for sellers we received a full price offer about three weeks from the date we listed.  We closed less than thirty days later for the full asking price.Here is the amazing part of that:  The appraiser, hired by the buyer, appraised our home $20,000 lower than our asking price.  Faith believed that the appraisal was flawed and showed the buyer‚Äôs agent and appraiser how and why it was flawed.  The appraiser studied Faith‚Äôs argument and adjusted his appraisal up.  Amazing!  Faith knows her stuff.Faith is the kind of agent that you want on your side when you are ready to sell your home.  We were really fortunate to find her."

Please shorten to ""Ask TD"" or ""Ask Ameritrade"". Also the most common info I would like is ""how's my portfolio?"" or ""how's my watchlist?""

There isn't a way to link my TD Ameritrade and Alexa accounts so I wasn't looking for a personal update, just a market update. Alexa went into a 60 second reading from a webpage about how to update my TD Ameritrade password. Ask, ""Alexa, ask TD Ameritrade for a MARKET update."" She says, ""You can get detailed information about the S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow. Which index would you like to hear more about?"" She could just as easily have given all 3 updates.

I use TDA on Alexa to check my watchlist and gainers/losers every morning, but the biggest value is the ability to check my account balances, so I know when a deposit has hit and I have funds for trading.  I recently got an Alexa with a screen and was pleasantly surprised to see that this skill also shows data on the screen for all the features I have used for the past year or so. In the past I've tried Alexa's default quotes, my banks skill, and the CNBC skill for a variety of market/finance info, but they're all lacking compared to the TDA offering."

In addition to be a good service to viewiers, it‚Äôs a model for others in the sector (both content providers like CNN, CNBC, etc., and service providers like the cable TV companies, cord cutting live streaming TV services like Hulu TV, AT&T DirecTV, etc.) who are racing to bring TV content to our phones, tablets and other screens to take note of.

When you do that, it will ask you to click that you agree.  I don't blame Fidelity in the least for what they tell you you'd be agreeing to, but once it's clear how much is out of Fidelity's control and in Amazon's control, you should think twice before agreeing.  I praise Fidelity for disclosing the risks in such detail. Unfortunately, many people click ""I agree"" without reading things and I don't know how many of them read reviews.  Just remember that once you agree, Fidelity no longer guarantees the security of your account."

However, if you don't care about this or any of the other issues mentioned below, here is how to use the Fidelity app. 1. Enable Fidelity Investments skill 2. Here are some samples from ""help"" (but remember, the answers are not real-time): Alexa, Ask Fidelity to get a quote for Amazon Alexa, Ask Fidelity to get me the market update Alexa, Ask Fidelity how is Amazon doing today 3. I found I could just say ""Alexa, ask Fidelity Apple"" and I would get a quote - again, not real-time.There are numerous other problems besides the real-time issue with the Fidelity Investments app, I will list them all now: 1. not real-time 2. no pre-market, no after-market quote 3. too chatty -- after a quote, the app asks me what else I want to do giving me options -- this is annoying 4. app sometimes does not understand me when I ask the app to Stop - I'd like an app that lets me ask the quote and be done with it, as Siri does. With this app, I actually have to tell Alexa to stop. 5. Spammy. After I do successfully (phew!) stop the app, I hear a ""Thank you for using Fidelity Investments"". This is really annoying.

I'd encourage anyone looking for a baller national economic news update to download this, as I initially thought the flash news update would be more applicable to Atlanta and I live in Chicago. So I was pleasantly surprised that is gave updates on GDP, speeches by Federal Reserve Governors and Bank Presidents, wage growth, and BLS employment number updates, all of which apply to the national economic outlook. I suppose this is because every reserve bank has it's nitch in national work. I'd really love it if the Board of Governors or the other Reserve Banks came out with their own briefings, as Atlanta's seems to be a simple algorithm that probably only reads from their banks news updates, but is ever-so-helpful to the busy econ nerd on the go!"

Spoken edition is a narrative reading of the articles on Wired's site.This mornings first article was a 1500 word piece on a relevant topic that is in the news and the narration lasted about 9 minutes. Then it launched the same ad, and started onto the next article on the site.Unfortunately because it's a flash briefing you can not skip from one article to the next, instead ""Alexa, Next"" moves you to the next part of your flash briefing (i.e. weather, etc.).

But we integrate Alexa into our home to make certain tasks easier. YNAB on Alexa does not make YNAB tasks easier, I end up spending more time fixing what I did via Alexa than if I had just waited to enter transactions on the PC. The inquiries seem to work well (what's my balance in such and such category) but entering transactions feels cludgy and does not save me time. I'm probably going to disable the skill, but will to continue use YNAB on the web and iOS. Now if I could get reports and search on iOS, I could die happy!"

Talk about disappointing. The name was such a build-up. I feel let down. Just, wow... it's so sad, so very very sad.Luckily, most KJs get a following before anyone ever realizes their business' name.

B07QKF8DDW,Jillian Zhorne - Little Elm Real Estate,Business & Finance,Tom,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very Bad Choice,"Reviewed in the United States on June 20, 2019","VERY poor experience. Provided poor customer service. Very slow to relay information. Suggested I see her realtor friend's overpriced house first, and upon seeing it, urged me to put in an offer on it ASAP as ""it will go fast."" It was a fix and flip with an already cracked ""custom stone etched concrete patio."" It sat for months and was reduced in price by 15% or so before selling. Consistently late for appointments, time after time. Urged me to use her financing person (Doug Turner at Brazos Bank) and was furious when I told her I was going with a different choice which offered a lower rate. A buyer side realtor should be looking out for my interests, while instead I think she was angry to miss out on potential illegal referral bonus from Doug. Urged me to use her inspector. When I informed her that I had found another one I preferred, she said ""<---inspector name---> I don't know who the heck they are."" Then reiterated I use her inspector and said I couldn't / shouldn't follow the inspector and ask questions. Suggested that her coworker/team leads husband (general contractor) fix a structural issue instead of going through required (for a structural issue no matter how small) permit process. After she quit my transaction, I did get the seller to agree to fix it, and ultimately required them to get a permit. Left me waiting nearly 24 hours before informing me that the seller signed my offer, and only did so after I texted her (for the third time) asking if she had heard anything. This cut into my 7 day option period.  Stated that she ""hates working for the buyer"" the second time I met her (should have been a red flag to walk away, but didnt realize it was so easy to walk away from a realtor).At any rate, whatever you do, DO NOT believe the 5 star reviews. She quit my transaction after the contract was signed. Then her lead insisted I still had to work with them. I raised heck with Fathom Realty and ultimately they released themselves from the contract as well. Thankfully I was able to get a realtor who was actually willing to work for me and we closed the sale with almost all of what I was requesting from the seller.Definitely STAY AWAY or you will have a nightmare experience like I did!"

B07HVWFWY8,Retirement Quick Tips with Ashley,Business & Finance,Raleighmatt,2.0 out of 5 stars,I don't like the political bent to some of the side comments she makes.,"Reviewed in the United States on February 28, 2021","Over the course of the last few weeks I detected a clear political bent to some of the small comments Ashley would make.  She doesn't outright support one party or person,  but in a way that's actually worse because what she does do is elevate one party and put down the other one in very passive aggressive ways with small comments here and there,  and opinions added at times.  I don't need someone nefariously sneaking in political views to what should be a mostly non political tip.  I'm not suggesting you can't mention the effects of a new tax proposal but if you go back and listen you will hear very clear partisan comments and opinions being expressed that are absolutely not factual or proven.  Stick to facts and don't present opinion unless you make it clear you are stating an opinion,  which you did not.  I don't appreciate that and frankly we have enough of people slyly expressing opinions under the guise of news and information.  As such, I removed this from my flash briefing."
B07HVWFWY8,Retirement Quick Tips with Ashley,Business & Finance,Eric Maier,4.0 out of 5 stars,A minute well spent,"Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2020","I listen to ‚ÄúThe One Minute Retirement Tip‚Äù every morning in my Alexa flash-briefing.  I‚Äôm 62 years old, and plan on retiring within the next five years.  I like this podcast, and recommend it to anyone in my situation.  The topics are of course only touched on, and not explored to any great depth or detail, and that‚Äôs a good thing.  A thought provoking overview of the many, many aspects of retirement is all I need.  I‚Äôve been surprised that focus isn‚Äôt always on just money.  The real-life, day to day, human part of retirement is also considered.  The narrator, Ashley Micciche, speaks in a very casual, unscripted manor that I find refreshing, although it‚Äôs a bit of an acquired taste.  Her voice is very youthful, and can seem a little out of place for the serious subject matter.  I looked up her YouTube videos just to see if she wasn‚Äôt a sixteen year old prodigy operating out of her parent‚Äôs basement.  (Turns out, not only is she a highly professional adult business woman, her company caters to business owners and/or people who have a lot more money than I do.)  Overall, ‚ÄúThe One Minute Retirement Tip‚Äù does its job: short, well thought out advice."

Why wouldn't you want to take a minute or two to hear a tip that may add or enhance the information we ALL need to know about retirement. It is something we all will face at some point or another, and it's certainly a factor that I've seen all too often, people are woefully under prepared for, and Ashley is here to help, one tip at a time. She has been generous enough to offer additional support via email and suggestions beyond her daily tips that you can take advantage of or not! It's up to you. If there's a day that the tip is something that you may find does not apply to you, you simply would say, ""Alexa, skip"" and move on... I have not done that yet! However, my point is.. keep 'em coming Ashley, I do appreciate your daily information, and your positive energy each morning to start my day!"

The presenter did not have any useful information but self promoted herself on other media outlets such as twitter and Facebook.Waste of time for any serious listener seeking real information.February 2020 - This is a follow-up review because Ashley specifically called out my first review ""on air"" today and said ""thank you"" for my review, even though it was uncharacteristically negative. Consequently, I felt I owed her a second opportunity for an honest critical review..... I have listened everyday since my original posting in August 2019. I believe Ashley has indeed up'ed the sophistication and usefulness of the information she provides. I appreciate when she speaks of topics not often discussed within the fluffy mainstream. I appreciate her speaking her opinion and then providing her rationale for her opinions. Her recent discourse and warnings about ETF's and market cap versus equal cap is prime example of excellent topical matter I look for in a good Retirement Tip podcast.I believe Ashley is a knowledgeable and skilled professional. I hope she continues to provide real financial protein, not zero cal fluff. Thanks Ashley,  F.B."

It baselessly tells you to use a machine learning algorithm, and sometimes even says a certain machine learning algorithm is ""better"" than another. Such algorithms are all different and have their own specific use cases, so comparing them in this way is misleading.I am surprised this skill made it past certification. Say ""Alexa, open Machine Learning Recommender"" to see what I mean. It says a statement, not sounding anything like a prompt or question, and then waits for input. Most of the time, skills that do this fail to pass certification."

  ¬†ActiveCore via Alexa is a pretty novel idea. I can undoubtedly see that this initial integration is only the beginning for this young platform from Comcast Business. The app is a tad sluggish when getting the data, but once it grabs the information about your network, the update via Alexa is clear and easy to understand. I started to check the status using the ActiveCore app on my iPhone while attending my daughter's violin practice, but ran out of time. As practice ended and when leaving the venue, I asked Alexa how my ActiveCore network was looking and I got a great readout while I was walking to my car! I imagine things will only get more robust and become an even better experience with time."

A sample episode I just heard is about why the team lost a client and what they would do differently to avoid it next time. Erik made a strong healthy statement that I liked: he won‚Äôt take on clients for less than six months, and he explained why. It's okay - it's healthy - for marketers to be picky about clients.Overall, can‚Äôt emphasize enough that I appreciate the transparency. When so much of the advertising and marketing world contains posturing and display cases of award trophies, it‚Äôs helpful to talk about what went wrong, too.Good content for anyone building up a marketing or similar consulting practice. Erik puts thought and effort into this show. Some episodes might be longer than a minute or two, as it‚Äôs also a podcast, but give this briefing a listen if you want to hear real talk about building an agency.P.S.

The skill seems to work fine, until you try to add a different bank. I have tried all kinds of variations to the phrase but I either get read the first banks balance again or/sometimes/ it will create a new bank, but it's like it doesnt understand what I'm saying and it names the bank something crazy. It would be more helpful if ""add a new piggy"" or something of the like was in the list of options that is given to you when you are using the skill.."

I‚Äôve listened to this guy for a couple months and felt the subject matter was great for new leaders and even a helpful refresher for the more experienced. Lately, I have noticed he is more frequently quoting the Bible and uses Jesus in his comparisons. Unfortunately his delivery style is a bit too preachy for me, and I would have preferred he took a more objective approach when using religious references. That being said, I do recommend this briefing for practicing Christians."

As a military officer, I receive a whole lot of leadership advice and mentoring but rarely is it focused on how to tackle challenges that come up on a regular basis.  Learning and overcoming challenges is how we become better leaders.  Paul presents quick ideas for growth in a 3 min (or so) daily message.  I have gone to work and posed many of his questions to co-workers that have sparked entertaining and thoughtful discussion among other leaders and have used his commentary as a basis for professional development presentations.  Thanks Paul!"

He admitted he refuses to meet with women alone for work purposes unless his wife is there or it is in a group setting.This recommendation he gave is a big problem, because it undoubtedly will decrease the opportunities women have at work. The last thing women need right now is even more isolation. Men vastly outnumber women as managers and senior leaders, so when they avoid, ice out or exclude women, we pay the price.Not worth listening to."

My concern is that the pin code necessary to access account information, pay bills, etc is stored as plain text in Alexa's voice history list, and can be read by anyone who looks. 99% of people are not going to know how to go on Amazon through their PC and clear that history, or scroll through hundreds of entries and delete it from the Alexa app. This to me pretty much negates the security aspect of requiring a pin, and so I removed the skill."

Right now is just says ""Checking ####"" or ""Savings ####"".  When you have more than one of an account type, it is impossible to know which account is which and using the online nicknames I have set would be great!2) Ability to show/hide certain accounts (this goes for online as well as the Alexa skill). I have an old long-closed credit card that is no use for me to see/hear. Even worse, this account is listed first by Alexa and is just an absolute waste of time to hear it go over the balance, last payment and open to buy for a closed account.Keep up the great work!

It's just a little bit slow right now, but I'm sure that will improve.We are really eager for this skill to develop even further, e.g. search for transaction by merchant name, transfer funds between accounts, send a check, etc.  But even in the meantime, this saves the need to login the old fashioned way for basic info!"

I‚Äôm not trying to be mean, but the content they discuss is often extremely basic and seems like it was written in 5 minutes during someone‚Äôs commute home. And the delivery could be a lot better. No offense to the guy who is currently reading, but if you want this to catch on and be as successful as possible, have a professional read it. It sounds like some random guy from the street is reading it, and it‚Äôs really hard for me to take it in thoughtfully or seriously. On the topics, I suggest really getting into some more interesting tips and tricks to stand out as a gentleman (culture, behavior at events, traditions, food, fashion hacks, dating, leadership, speech, how to carry oneself / project confidence, etc.). options are almost limitless. With the delivery, you have to find someone else. I‚Äôll give it a little longer, but then will delete it if that doesn‚Äôt change. Sorry.

I might be wrong, but like I said seems like they are pretty strong or at least credible in the space.Anyway, like how quick and easy it is for me to see the notification on my Echo that there's an update. Then I just ask for it and there it is. Plus the updates are quick (seems to average around thirty seconds or so).This might be important to some (not so much me but kinda nice). The skill also lets you ask about the company, the founders, see their pix and hear them read their own bios. Like I said, not really that important to me, but kinda cool and a nice way to learn more, and hands-free (that I dig).  I listened while brushing my teeth. For me, that's better than staring, yet even more, at my laptop screen :-)  Pow!"

I downloaded yesterday and tried it out.  The content that I sampled was redundant with what I've heard on the pod cast.  This might be better for someone less obsessed with listening every week.  On the other hand, perhaps this would be a great place to deploy content that supplements the pod cast.  In which case, Molly and Kai could promote that there are gems (extended interviews, etc) available on the Echo.  Technically, the app got stuck in a loop and would only accept one of the other subject areas.  To get out of the loop, I finally shut the echo down.  I think there needs to be a better way to say goodbye for now."

B07DFCMTN2,Make Me Smart,Business & Finance,Suzushka,5.0 out of 5 stars,Huh. So that‚Äôs how you spell ‚ÄòMolly Wood‚Äô...,"Reviewed in the United States on June 29, 2018","I‚Äôve actually been wondering. Well, yah know, ‚ÄòKai Ryssdal‚Äô is so obvious I just couldnt help it. üôÉOK, *serious üßê face* for a sec. I see tremendous potential for Alexa as a user interface for collecting listener feedback. For the focus-challenged, mental-landscape wandering, MMS-wavelength oriented regular like me, Alexa is a means for collecting succinct, directed, scope-defined responses in near real time and conveniently in podcast-friendly audio format. Perhaps this isnt a widespread problem with the MMS audience at large, but I personally struggle to provide feedback despite frequently having the strong desire to do so, because I simply have too much I‚Äôm inspired to say. If i were to write an email response, I would have trouble keeping it at sub-Tolstoyian lengths. Though well-intentioned, it would be a challenge to integrate into podcast format and may not make it back to yall before relevence has diminished in the wake of the latest outrage or executive faux pas . But interfacing via the echo, I can easily capture and send my feedback as my response arises to my mind while taking advantage of fast, integrated voice commands to execute.  I suspect there will be an efficiency gain back at the studio, too, since the various commands that can be assigned to trigger recording can also be used to triage the incoming responses.I really hope to see this aspect expand to include more Alexa skills/commansthemes like block chain, meta-data & data rights (I have so much to say on that, Molly. So much. And pre-Cambridge Analytica, I was a very lonely warrior...lol). And of course, to collect responses to the MMS signature question, so brilliantly designed to induce individual self-reflection while facilitating empathic bonding (both soft skills badly needed in these times of growing ideological division).Bottom line: I cant wait to try it out! Also, you guys rock!! So much! Thanks for being people i like to like, and who like what i like, and who make the world a better place by advocating positive and intelligent cohesion üòá!"

WRONG.  Homeschooling is not the same as Online School.Online school is attending a school, ONLINE, which is what most students are doing during the current crisis.  They are still enrolled in a public or private school and access the curriculum virtually.Homeschooling is when a student doesn't attend a school (is not enrolled in a public school), but is educated at home, by the parents or a group of parents/people.I hope they have a correction on this as its a BIG DIFFERENCE between the two."

It is fun, informative, and most are fact filled; but some are rubbish and politicized.  Particularly ""Founding Fathers"" was sadly misinformed as most founding fathers of this country were not super wealthy and did either plan to or make every effort to see slavery eliminated. Three did not own any slaves at all.  Molly's report on the Founding Fathers make them look like a bunch of wealthy, white men only in it for the money aka the 1619 project.  This was a time in history when they knew if they insisted upon immediately eliminating slavery there would be no USA.  Stick to the facts or don't report on it at all."

I don't know of a way to get her to list the stocks on my watch list. Like many people have been saying their needs to be a way to edit your watch list so that you can correct the app.  It is very hard to keep control because she misunderstands you and could add/subtract stocks on you watch list.

B077XL4DVH,Front Row Entrepreneur,Business & Finance,D. Hines,1.0 out of 5 stars,Updated content,"Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2018","I think the information is good, however she only updates her information weekly, which means if you use your flash briefing to start your day, it‚Äôs very annoying to hear the same information and recording for multiple days. Last week she said something incorrectly, and she caught her mistake which was good, but she caught it in the middle of her recording. With her only updating once a week I got to hear her stumble through the mistake each morning, I just wanted to stop my entire flash briefing because hers are so long. If she broke up her information she‚Äôd have enough content for a few days. Finally, she gives a plug for classes, she might be great with sharing content but I would not buy into taking a class from her for flash briefings given what I‚Äôve observed so far. I think she has a lot of potential. I‚Äôve not deleted her flash briefing, just moved it to the end so I can be out the door by the time she begins in case it‚Äôs the same information. I‚Äôll keep listening for a few more weeks, with the hopes she gets better."

The first one was a very small piece of property, for very little money, but lots of questions! Ryan handled that tiny transaction as if it was a million dollar property. Good old fashioned customer service, honesty & hard work. Hard to find these days. When it came to selling our ‚Äòmillion dollar view‚Äô property and to downsize. Ryan was the only realtor I considered. I have bought and sold many properties in my lifetime. Ryan is the true professional. He‚Äôs proactive, providing all the info up front, unless a buyer & their realtor can‚Äôt read, all the info (accurate info) is provided WITH the listing. Preventing any confusion. He holds the other ‚Äòside‚Äô accountable and believes everyone needs to abide by the agreed upon ‚Äòcontract‚Äô. Therefore eliminating a lot of issues. If there are issues, he handles them, and sometimes tells you later‚Ä¶. Eliminating a lot if the stress. Ryan is the ONLY realtor I feel extremely comfortable recommending 100%. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, there are a lot of very nice realtors out there, but if you want a friend, hire them. If you want to make a friend AND the job gets done proficiently, on time, without surprises ‚Ä¶.. hire Ryan! He‚Äôs done an excellent job selling me property, listing and selling my property, then helping me close a deal on our downsize. Thanks Ryan!!"

Ryan was excellent at explaining step-by-step what we should expect next, was always making sure to keep us in the loop of anything that was going on, and even if he wasn‚Äôt the correct person we should have asked questions to--- he always would go the extra mile to find out the answers for us. He was always available to us either through email, text or phone and was extremely prompt in response time in getting back to us if he wasn‚Äôt available immediately. He would take time on the weekends, and evenings to show us homes when it was convenient for US even though I know this HAD to interfere with his time off.Ryan is an extremely personable individual who is so easy to talk to and by the end of the whole process, I felt as if we had known each other forever. If you are in the market to buy a home from someone who is charming, well-informed, diligent in wanting to find you the perfect home  and willing to do what it takes to get the job done without a hitch, Ryan is the man for you!Thanks Ryan for all your hard work!! We REALLY couldn‚Äôt have done it without you and I am so ecstatic that I got the chance to meet and work with you. We couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better person to help us in buying the perfect home!Sincerely,Kathie & Stephen Hall"
B07ZRKSZQ7,Ryan Smith - Knoxville and Maryville Real Estate,Business & Finance,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Looking for a amazing realtor!,"Reviewed in the United States on April 29, 2021","Our family survived a big move, but I don‚Äôt think we would have made it through the process without Ryan! The first time we met Ryan was 2 to 3 years ago to purchase a vacant lot beside our home. At that time, he made the process so easy and smooth. So, when we decided to list our house back in February we knew exactly who to call. We immediately called him to setup a meeting to see what to do to get our house listed. Everything had to line up perfectly for this to happen! We had to list our house that we were living in, and also list the lot that we had previously purchased. However, the catch was that we would not let the lot go unless the house was sold also! Well, it all happened just like it needed to. Ryan provided much needed guidance throughout the complete process. Not only that, but anytime we requested to go see a home that was listed he always did his best to make it happen and always adapted to our crazy schedules. Even though selling a home can be so stressful, Ryan made it easy and always there to help. Our family enjoyed the times of laughing our way through the process with Ryan and getting to know him. If we should ever need to move again Ryan will be our go to!Kelly"
