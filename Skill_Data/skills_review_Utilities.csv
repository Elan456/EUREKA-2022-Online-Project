B07CR8G7DV,counting coach,Utilities,Eweforia,5.0 out of 5 stars,Counts slowly out loud--perfect for exercises,"Reviewed in the United States on July 25, 2019","Update: Thank you developers for returning the slow  counting speed back to its previous slow speed. This app is the ONLY one available that simply counts out loud. Not a stopclock, not a metronome, not a child' learn numbers tool. I'm back to happily giving this app a 5-star review.Previous: I've been happily using this app for over a year to count reps for some exercises I do and up until today, I would have given it a 5 star review. I liked that I could ask the count to be VERY SLOW. Today, that slow speed has dramatically increased, preventing me from being able to complete a weight lift in time before the next number is counted. Developer, please revert to the timing speed you used prior to today."
B01EKKF81Q,Nanny State,Utilities,She Who is Unnamed,4.0 out of 5 stars,"please confirm with a parental ""UNIT""","Reviewed in the United States on September 24, 2016","it's basic . .. and asks:""is your room tidy?""  if you answer Yes, it next asks:""have you practiced your instrument?""  if you answer Yes, it next asks:""is your homework done?""  if you answer Yes, it next asks:""are your chores done?""  if you answer Yes, it next asks:""do you have screen time (TV) privileges?""  if you answer Yes, it says""congratulation you have screentime, please confirm with a parental unit.""if you answer No, it says ""No Screens for you"" ...I about fell on the floor laughing when it said please confirm with a parental ""UNIT"".I hate to brag but I, yes me, She Who is Unnamed, I, invented the phrase parental unit, I started saying that well OVER 35 plus years ago. That's why I am laughing. And why I added an extra üåü. But a 3 star rating is because, as follows:if adjusting the questions were available this would be better, considering every student doesn't play an instrument, and since a majority of schools have eliminated their music programs, and every child who might want to play an instrument doesn't always have access to instruments to practice, but they might have something else that the ability to change or adjust ""practice"" here would apply, or be able to insert options for special projects in addition to homework...  also, customizing options, to be able to adjust by person... Not all children are the same, even in the same family.  But this is an awesome starting for an app of this type. wish this was availaible when my kids were little - 25 plus years too late - one last side note would be to add features for grandma's, for when the little ones visit."
B01EKKF81Q,Nanny State,Utilities,Kathleen,1.0 out of 5 stars,There's just no substitute for real parenting,"Reviewed in the United States on September 24, 2016","Dev clearly does not have children. What's stopping the kid from saying yes to all questions just to get screen time? Better yet, what's stopping the kid from just turning on the TV? Alexa? I don't think so. Who's going to do quality control? &quot;Did you do your HW?&quot; &quot;Yes&quot; &quot;Did you answer all questions? Let me see/check.&quot; Oh wait, you can't.

B07X482SMG,My Lingo - English to Spanish Translator,Utilities,Photo Lover,3.0 out of 5 stars,Mas despacio por favor,"Reviewed in the United States on September 23, 2019","i really was hoping there would be an option for the alexa to spell or say the Spanish words more slowly. if I am asking MyLingo about a word, it is because I dont know it. Then, MyLingo says the word very quickly at the speed Alexa does. So theres really no reason to have this skill...I get it that Spanish is a fast language, but that is what makes it hard. when I hear Alexa quickly say ‚Äúplanifacador‚Äù at the speed of light or whatever I have no clue what she even said or how to spell it - did she just say ‚Äúplafor‚Äù or ‚Äúplador‚Äù or ‚Äúplanificdor?‚Äù Spelling in Spanish is easy, but you have to know the word you‚Äôre spelling. it would be better to use the english spanish dictionary at this rate, exasperatingly. so please, make there an option for a slow or even spelled out version. this would make it great. thank you!! üòÜ"

B073J7FLY2,Pizza Calculator,Utilities,The Fine Print,4.0 out of 5 stars,Hmmmm...BACON,"Reviewed in the United States on July 4, 2017","I was skeptical but this skill has the word ""pizza"" in it -- not to mention a friendly looking slice of pizza as the icon -- so I had to try it. Turns out, it was actually pretty good (just like the pizza I ate). I was afraid it would be a cheesy app that tells me facts about pizza, but instead, it was different. This skill tries to compare two pizzas to see which is the better deal. I like that it was interactive and you don't have to enter everything in one mouthful. After entering the company name, it then prompts you for the size, and finally the price, and so on.  It then tells you which pizza is cheaper per square inch. So you could compare a large and a medium by the same pizza seller, and see if you should get the large for a little more, or the medium for a little less. In my case, the large did save me a few cents per square inch.  It would be 5 stars if it could tell me how much I will save by ordering the pizza it recommends. For example it could say ""the large is 2 cents per square inch cheaper. Your large pizza is xxx square inches, so you will save $1.96 by buying the large"". Overall, a highly recommended app for all the pizza eaters out there. It might save you some dough. Would be interested to hear what others think. (By the way, anchovies is small fish pickled in oil, in case you are new to pizza. Does anyone actually like fish on their pizza?)"

So I searched skills for additional to do lists that might have that ability but didn't find anything... However, I did see this skill and I thought maybe I could at least get one more reminder list. Nope. First off, it was hard for me to launch...Alexa just kept adding 'keys' to my to do list, which I then have to go to the app and clear.. finally did get it launched and here is what it asked me.... Do I have my keys? Do I have my ID?  Do I have a payment method? Ummmm.... really? if you can't remember that stuff then you are probably drunk. So if you frequently head down to the bar when you are already drunk and can't remember what to take then this is probably a great app for you.

At that point I am doing all the work. It doesn't ask me if I have my MetroCard, which is the thing I forget most often. I keep a list of things I need on the door, and for now that's way more useful.I am also going to try to design one via Blueprint. It would be nice to be reminded to bring my handkerchief, lip balm, pills, a sweater, etc while I am still packing.The designers of this need to realize that their list falls way short for most people, as our lives vary widely.

But every time I ask Alexa to play/open Baby Shush, she starts playing the song Baby Shark...which is maybe the worst song ever when you‚Äôre trying to get your baby to sleep. Obviously people are using this app to get their kid to fall asleep, so it‚Äôs really annoying that every time you launch the app, Alexa tells you the directions of how to listen and how to pause (why does she feels the need to explain this?). And worse yet, once you‚Äôve got your kid fast asleep and you ask Alexa to stop the app, she says ‚ÄúTHANKS FOR LISTENING!‚Äù, and wakes up the baby!! Why in the world an app designed to put and keep babies asleep is so poorly designed, I do not understand.Not recommended. Just download a free shush or white noise app on your phone."

Tried both, but when saying ""Alexa, Ask Days Until, How Long Until Hawaii?"" it replies with ""Sure, what event?"" every time.  I am asking it the exact phrase it told me to ask it when setting up the event, so I'm not sure why it doesn't work.  And when I say ""Hawaii"" after it asks me for what event, it hears me fine, so I know it's recognizing the word ""Hawaii"".  Same exact problem with ""Maui"".  Also, I should be able to just say ""Alexa, Ask Days Until Hawaii"", rather than ""Ask Days Until, How Long Until Hawaii"" -- that is a mouthful, and hard to remember.  Or better yet: ""Alexa, Days Until Hawaii"".  It would be a great skill if it worked like that -- I would use it every day."

Days do not change at midnight.Difficulty adding events due to the Alexa device listening to early...... using her own voice as part of the answer. Every event would be called 'Event' unless I spoke prevoius to her finishing the question. Some small delays in question/answer are needed.Events work great, entry can be challeging.

Upon activating the routine it will give you the date followed by the time. There is no way to adjust the order of this information or to use a different date template, IE Day month year as compared to the default Month Day Year. The biggest issue is the reason I enabled this skill is to use my ""good morning"" routine. While you can add the skill to any routine, the skill insists on being the last skill on the list. That is unfortunate as I'd much rather have this information at the start. With that being said, it's still the best skill I've found for the job at this point."

Worked flawlessly for a year.  Then the founder passed and I can only assume they began cutting corners.  First, shore power sensor defect led to ""disconnect immediately, risk of fire""....took months to receive replacement.  Next, an update to their app broke notifications.  They argued that I never should have received those notications in the first place before admitting they had changed the behavior of the app.  Then came a fix, and the ability to switch from armed to aboard to disarmed stopped working.  They argued it ""must be your provider"", even though my cell and the system had full connection  and I would receive notifications about shore power immediately.  Then they admitted the app was broken.  Several subsequent ""fixes"" fixed nothing.  After 7 months the system still does not work, and their solution is that I should buy a manual switch and install it in a discrete location.  Their support is horrible, they lie and argue about their bad software, and expect the customer to spend money to fix their mistakes, all while continuing to charge a subscription fee.

B06X6GZDP4,Mr. Butler,Utilities,Amy,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Cool concept, bad implimentation. Bug explaination and instructions below.","Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2019","if you tell it that you put something ""on"" something else then it triggers Alexas ""turn on"" function. So Alexa will cancel out butler and search for devices that she can turn on for you. (or at least that's what it seems like is happening) Which is super frustrating and probably a quick fix for an experienced programmer; a check to see if your using butler and then don't kick the user back out to alexa. This has apparently been a problem since the second top rated review which was posted in 2017, 2 years ago. So I'm disappointed that it hasn't been fixed and I don't think it will be fixed soon. If you plan to use this app, it will be good for you to know that you have to tell it you put stuff ""IN"" stuff because otherwise it bugs out. and it also doesn't seem to know the word ""near"" or ""under"". Just ""IN""Also there are a lot of glitches calling Mr. Butler up, almost everytime Alexa will not recognize that your trying to use the skill and ask if you want to use the skill. when you say yes. she just kinda goes ""just ask"" leaving me sitting here going ""Just ask what?"" and I still haven't figure it out. it would help if she spelled out the kind of questions you should ask for mr. Butler.over all since starting to write this review I have dropped my rating by a star and told Alexa to disable Mr. Butler. Maybe when I get more competent with programming I can make us all a better Butler."

Yes, it stops when you say Alexa, Stop. However, as others stated, it responds that the skill is paused and to say Resume to restart it. That does not sound so bad, but it is. From then on, any time tou tell Alexa to stop doing anything, be it Spotify or another skill, it replies, Morning Rooster can help you with that‚Äî which gets really old really quickly. Even deleting the routine and disabling the skill did not fix it. There are other rooster alarms out there that will not do this. Do not get this one unless you want to reboot your device to get rid of the annoying, repetitive glitch that will hound you any time you use Alexa to turn off anything else."

What is the point of having an ""alarm"" which must be manually activated each morning?  The only good point is that it is sufficiently LOUD.

To get it to work requires three commands and the patience to listen to a verbose explanation.  Sigh. First, you cannot say ""Tell Audible Clock to  set..."" because it doesn't get it.  So,  first you have to open the app. Then, when it's open,  you have to sit through a 20- second instruction of how to choose a specific clock, even if you already know all this.  Then, after you've chosen a specific clock, you have to have yet another conversation about how often you want the clock to chime/speak/ whatever. To add more frustration,  the clock needs to be reset if other skills are used. Technology is supposed to make my life simpler, not busier. I will not subscribe to the premium version unless these problems are solved."
B07QH6887V,Audible Clock,Utilities,LRobb,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this app,"Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2021","Great app! If you want it to run non-stop without Alexa terminating the app upon a request, there‚Äôs a work around, but it involves two Alexa Echo ‚Äúdevices‚Äù in the same room, as your going to set this app up to have its own dedicated Echo. This method has been working for me for many months. Set this app up as you normally would initally. Create a Routine for it so it will start the app at the time you choose, but be sure to select the second Echo in the Routine as the device that the app will play the audio from. You also need to make sure that the Echo that plays the audio is always muted so it doesn‚Äôt respond to requests & terminate the running app. Your essentially giving the app its own ‚Äúspeaker.‚Äù Note, if your Echo is muted, when it looses power or reboots, it will still be muted when it cones back on, so no need to push the mute button everytime it reboots. So, I placed my second Echo running this app by my TV where its out of sight, & its like I have the real thing in the room when it chimes. A couple of pointers or suggestions. The app wont restart in the event the Echo is rebooted or unplugged, you‚Äôll have to manually run the Routine or wait for the Routine to run again at the scheduled time. I did find if you make two Routines to run the app twice a day, thats a good solution for this. Tip, if using two Routines to restart the app daily, try adding a volume change to the two Routines. If you set one Routine in the morning at full volume & one at night at very low volume, every time the Routine runs it will adjust the volume for you while restarting the app, this is something I found very useful at night when sleeping. Again no need to worry about muting it, it will remain muted until you unmute it manually regardless of what the Routine does with the volume. If you set it up this way, you‚Äôll give it five stars."

Brown,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good application,"Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2019","With recent updates you can select to chime quarter, half, three quarter or on the hour. I like the grandfather clock, it's all the ambiance without the bulky, albeit beautiful piece of furniture. I still have to tell Alexa to play Audible Clock occasionally, but i think of it as if I had to wind the clock, otherwise it runs quietly in the background. There's a wide variety of sounds to choose from. Its a house favorite."
B07QH6887V,Audible Clock,Utilities,R. Dorsinville,3.0 out of 5 stars,Works great... by itself,"Reviewed in the United States on July 27, 2019",This skill works well but does not work with other skills running. Unlike built-in reminders or alarms that 'pop-up' during music or audio playing this skill will not run. Until that happens I either have to I keep running it again or dedicate an Alexa device to run it exclusively. Also whenever I use one of the voices to say the time it starts stating the time by saying 'TickTock....'. Fortunately for me I have a dedicated Echo just to run this skill which does work as described.

Audible should investigate to discover why this skill only works for a very small portion of users as well as improve their help request responses.I would love this skill if it would work!Audible, I‚Äôll check back in the future to see if this app is working as it brings back great memories from my childhood grandfather clock.UPDATE:The issue with the skill not working is not by fault of the skill but by how Alexa allows skills to be used. This is a great skill but Alexas operation will not allow it to continually sound hourly without using alexa for anything else.Also, for help contact them through email and you will receive great customer service. I wrote in the ‚Äúhelp‚Äù section and posted this review but didnt get this great service until I emailed.Again, great skill and service but Alexa wont allow it to run as I had hoped."

Love that it ticks all the time and that you can hear the full fade of the hourly bongs long after they strike.  But here's what I had to do to get it to work consistently (following others' advice here in the reviews/comments):1) You must have a dedicated dot else every other interaction with your dot will stop the app.2) I setup a routine to start the clock and can use it to restart in the event of a power blip or random interruption. I couldn't just ask the Dot to start the app as it kept starting the ""Audible"" book app instead.3) Once you start the app, you have to manually tell it which clock to use.  I couldn't add that to the routine.4) Once the clock is started, MUTE the microphone on the dot.  This dot will ONLY be used for the clock and nothing else.5) Go into your Alexa app and to this dedicated device.  I called mine Clock Dot.  Turn OFF the COMMUNICATIONS for this dot.  If you don't every delivery notification, reminder, alarm, whatever, will stop the app and you'll have to restart again.6) My clock has now been running for several days without interruption."

I asked alexa for the safety rating for New York City just for kicks, I was greeted with ""I'm not sure wich city you wanted the after rating for, try again"" I asked trying all 3 ways this page suggests saying New York City, The City of New York, New York, Manhattan, Brooklyn, the neighborhood of Manhattan and nothing. I then tried Baltimore, Detroit, Chicago, Philadelphia, London, Vancouver, Buenos Aires even Los Angeles didn't work the first 2 times. San Francisco, LA and Irvine are the only cities I got to work. Also, not to mention Alexa just responds with ""very safe"" ""safe"" or ""unsafe""... Ok, it's is like Lisbon were I'll be robbed or Detroit were ill be shot. Also a distant feature might be adding a way to check specific neighborhoods in a city. Example, Essex in Baltimore is very unsafe while Canton is a very safe area is a very nice area so calling the whole city safe or unsafe is gross over generalization. Add way more cities, a justification for its rating and neighborhoods then you got a real app. This is just a silly meme."

The same holds true to the parallel and series calculation. I need to know what resistors to combine to get a certain value, not what the resistance of a combination is."

What an obnoxious waste of time.  I haven't used the skill in years, because I couldn't get it to work properly.  I finally thought I'd try it again to see if it had been updated.  After asking multiple times in multiple ways to turn on the skill or add a new stopwatch, alexa finally told me that my stopwatch was running at 900-some days.  She then announced all of the things the app can do and would not stop talking.  I was unable to say anything to convince alexa to stop, the timer or delete the program, so I had to check a bunch of skills on the amazon site, all titled Stopwatch, to find which one was enabled, so I could disable it.  have no idea why this ""skill"" is still available on amazon.  What a nightmare!"
B019DB6YNI,stopwatch,Utilities,MamaSylvia,4.0 out of 5 stars,Best available stopwatch skill,"Reviewed in the United States on February 4, 2018","This seems to be the best of the available stopwatch skills, which sadly isn't saying much. I really waffled about whether to give it 3 or 4 stars, and finally decided on 4 because I'll only have to remember 2 commands - launch and stop - and it will let me play music at the same time. That is what I need a stopwatch skill for.- There is a lot of variation in the command format. For example, ""Alexa, launch stopwatch"" or ""Alexa, start stopwatch"" starts a new stopwatch if one isn't already running - otherwise it gives you the status of the one running. But ""Alexa, status stopwatch"" or ""Alexa, stopwatch status"" doesn't work. ""Alexa, stop stopwatch"" also produces the status but does NOT stop the stopwatch. You have to say ""Alexa, ask stopwatch to stop"" to actually end it. Is it really necessary to use such a roundabout format?- For actually using it, pretty much count on having to say ""Alexa, ask stopwatch to"" (pause, resume, stop). The simpler ""Alexa, launch stopwatch"" will start it or give you the status.- As others have said, this isn't a precision function. I just want to time how long I can pedal on the exercise bike, so a few seconds' variation won't make a difference to me. But if seconds matter to you, there isn't an Alexa skill that will meet your needs.- More important to me, this runs in the background so I can have Alexa play music while I am on the exercise bike and still keep track of my time."

B07JHLR5TW,T-Minus Countdown,Utilities,Brian D,4.0 out of 5 stars,Finally!,"Reviewed in the United States on April 22, 2021","After playing around with it, I discovered the following small restrictions/quirks:1) It has a soft clock ticking sound while running. That's actually avery smart and very good thing (keep reading)....2) While it's running, you can still use your Echo to do things like turn lights on and off. You can also ask it questions (eg. ""Who is the current president""). It will do those things and continue the soft ticking when done.  UPDATE:  HIT OR MISS.  These things can cause the skill to stop without notice.3) You cannot play music, streaming OR bluetooth, on THAT device while the skill is running. That stops the ticking, stops the skill. So the ticking at least reassures you the countdown has not been interrupted. You can stream music on other Alexa devices, though, so that's a great thing.4) Any ""stop"" command that you use while it is running will also stop the countdown.So, all in all, it's a very good skill among a ton of less-useful skills.  UPDATE:  Just run it on one of your Echos that you won‚Äôt interact with.  Also, it does not do minute by minute for long countdowns.  In a two-hour countdown, for example, the first announcement comes 15 minutes into the countdown, gradually increasing in frequency.  Please add a way to announce every minute."

The launch phrase is good but I feel like there should be a couple of other statements that can get you there as well.I felt like they when on the cheap for the sound effects as they had a thin tinny kind of timbre. I would also like to jump on to the woodpile, stated in many of the other reviews, regarding the lack of ""KABOOM!!"" of some sort at the termination of the countdown. Perhaps I'm bringing my Boomer (ha! see what i did there?) non-nihilist aesthetic to this ""it was said ironically"" world; but, I found Alexa (I hope to god I didn't type that too loud or my bathroom lights are bound to start turning on and off) saying, ""That's it."" in as nonplussed a way as she can to be somewhat anticlimactic.For what is essentially $5, this routine should be better in sound quality for sure and, either executed on the straight and narrow or, had a better comic writer."

I don't even know if this is the stopwatch app in my Alexa. It appears there are many. But I asked her for a stopwatch and she loaded a recommendation.  Like lots of others, once it started I couldn't get it to stop.  I don't think AI is supposed to make you feel so stupid and frustrated you want to throw your Echo Dot into the microwave just to see what happens.  I had to laugh at myself and this idiot device that I'm sure costs $millions in development trying to do something I can do much easier with my $19 Casio watch from Walmart. I just thought it would be cool if Alexa could do it.  Apparently, AI is not as advanced as they show us in the movies. Fortunately, I found the reviews from other frustrated users telling me the 'magic' word. :-)BTW, the command was 'Alexa, delete stopwatch.'  (Who 'deletes' a stopwatch?)"
B074XF7F68,Stopwatch,Utilities,George Corser,2.0 out of 5 stars,Better than nothing?,"Reviewed in the United States on April 4, 2021","Commands are awkward. Example: The stopwatch displays only when you say, ""launch stopwatch"" . That is the stopwatch starts ticking when you launch it. To see the stopwatch periodically you have to keep saying ""launch stopwatch"" . That means if the stopwatch is already running it just displays the current time elapsed. If you say ""stop stopwatch"" it displays the stopwatch, that is it does the same thing as ""launch stopwatch"" . You have to say ""ask stopwatch to stop"" or ""ask stopwatch to delete"" to actually stop the stopwatch. Way too awkward to use for precision timing!"
