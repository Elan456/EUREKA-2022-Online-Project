Yep. I had to place 5 separate orders since the app only lets you order one at a time. But the orders went throug, so I got over it. Until I received 4 emails 10 minutes later saying that my information cannot be verified, so they cancelled my order.  The email I get tells me no information on how to fix the verification issue that apparently was an issue on 4 of the 5 orders I placed. But they could verify me for one of my orders?  Then when I tried to chat with Best Buy customer service, their chat was down. Seriously?  This was a terrible user experience on both the Amazon side and the Best Buy side. You both can and should be better than this. I won’t be using this app again."

The geek squads computer did not flag my stove's cost of repairs as a lemon and that team was not notified for an escalation, and surpassed the allotted repair warranty amount. I received a text that my warranty was canceled and have a broken Samsung 5.9 cu. ft. Flex Duo Free Standing Electric Range Model Number NE59M6850SS stove. I paid $1,500 thinking made a great purchase and paid for the safety of extended warranty . Well that did not work! I talked to many Geek Squad representative's on the phone all around the world truly... took hours and hours of my time. The contract does not state that there is a dollar amount cut off because it is built into the geek squad system. I was told my work orders were deleted, and I wasn't in the computer. I have spent thousands of dollars at Best Buy over the years and I feel this is not right. The only thing they offered me was to purchase another warranty for $299, but that wouldn't cover parts."

B01N188I03,Bring! Shopping List,Shopping,Jamazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Great idea, poorly executed","Reviewed in the United States on May 12, 2017","Works poorly. I love the Bring! app on my phone. Use it regularly for shopping with the family so everyone can add things. So having Alexa integration was awesome, if it would work!Had no problem syncing it to my main grocery list (no idea how to pick a different list to add things too appropriate list.  Here's an idea, have a command to List my lists, so I know what Alexa calls them).Hassle to open.  Have to say ""Alexa, open Bring!"", she says ""welcome to bring, how can I help"" ,then after each item is added she has to talk more.  Keep the skill open forever.  I installed if for a reason. I should just be able to say ""Alexa, add milk to my list"" without activating a skill EVERY time.But I could live with this, but the kicker, Bring! constantly gets it wrong.  Alexa understands my voice fairly well, but for some reason, Bring! gets the item wrong 6 out of 10 times.  I say something clearly, and she adds some obscure item.  If it is wrong, I have no way of removing and re-speaking it.  I ALWAYS end up opening the phone app to correct the misunderstandings, or to verify she understood.I really want this skill to work.  It is a great skill in theory, and I keep trying hoping it will improve, but after weeks and weeks of using it, I decided it was time to write a review.Bring! Labs.... PLEASE fix this!Make her talk less,Allow me to delete last entry.  If I say ""delete"" right after she repeats the entry, would be nice, because she is wrong SO often.Give option to read the list (even things added previously from the phone app)Provide some instructions.  I'm just guessing on this Alexa skill.  Need a ""help"" command.2 stars is being generous, only because I like the idea of this and hope it will get fixed."

Shopping List,Shopping,Lezza Baker,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great App, Alexa doesn’t want you to use it","Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2020","I love this app. It does everything I want from a shopping list app and more. No icon for what I want? No problem as they eventually add one. Very intuitive and useful. However.,, Alexa doesn’t seem to want you to use this app, because sometimes she “forgets” it is setup in your skills. I’ve gotten everything from Brain surgery websites to Fire TV shows to ? Things that aren’t even close (even if I spell it out!). Frustrating that this app works so well and Alexa doesn’t like you to use it."

Shopping List,Shopping,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,"Reviewed in the United States on March 28, 2017","It is so nice to finally have a list app that works on my phone, smart watch and Alexa. Our family has been using this for about a week now, and we really like it. No bugs either. I do have a suggestion though - it would be nice if we could simply say which list we want to add the item to rather than having to change the default list each time. Ex: Alexa, tell Bring to add milk to the ""Costco"" list (rather than having to change from the default ""groceries"" list to the ""Costco"" list beforehand)."

Just ask “Alexa, open Bring and add ketchup!” And it’ll be on your list the next time you go shopping. The speech recognition is extremely accurate for adding any item, even uncommon ones - it has yet to get anything wrong on the list!"

All ten of my echos, spots, dots and shows had to be set to English US. Even though we are officially recognised by Amazon now all of the skills still only recognise English US or GB. There is no AU.  I guess I can talk like a yank til we are completely integrated in to the English speakers of the world. Meh, at least it works now."

Sometimes items I ask Alexa to add end up on my Bring list, and sometimes they end up on Alexa's default shopping list.  No rhyme or reason that I can figure out.

We love that we can tell Alexa to add to our grocery list, but the failure to allow Alexa Show to access and display our recipes really has us bummed.  We bought the Show primarily to display our own recipes while cooking, and it was a big let down when we discovered our favorite app doesn't integrate.

B074PDF3ZY,AnyList,Shopping,BrittanyKiLee,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works perfectly!,"Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2017","It’s been functioning great for me so far, no issues or complaints!  I love to simply be able to tell Alexa to add something to my list. Yes, it might be cool if you could add multiple items rather than one at a time, however, to me the main purpose of this is to be able to add items as you think of them/need them. I open the fridge and see I’m low on milk, “Alexa, add milk to my shopping list.”  Done!  Without grabbing my phone, it’s there. Then 10 minutes later I notice another item to add. Easy and simple. Sure it could be cool in certain scenarios where I do have a long list to add, in which case it could get tiring saying each item one at a time, but for the most part the ability to add things to your list with your voice is to avoid needing to sit down and think... “what are all the items I’m currently out of and need to pick up at the store....”. I don’t need to do this, because I slowly added them as they came to mind. And that to me is what makes this so awesome and functional for my life!  Even before I used Alexa, generally I was only adding one or two items at a time to my list, and this is what would be annoying. I’d grab my phone, add an item, minutes or so later I’d remember something else I need, back to my phone to write it down. Now I simply keep doing what I’m doing, tell Alexa and it’s done!"

Items cannot be added to specific lists but only the generic Alexa shopping list.  Drilling down into (adding items to) specific lists would be welcome (#newskill).  This is especially true since these unique lists can be shared with Alexa who can tell you what's on them but not interact with (add/delete items) them.modding this review.  As a test, I tried to get Alexa to add items to my BJs list on Anylist.  But Alexa did not recognize Bj's.  I tried Giant and Walmart lists and it did put items directly into those custom lists - lists that I had already created in Anylist and then selected to sync with Alexa.  So yes - it works, but for some reason it does not recognize all my Anylist list names.  So I'm gonna try to train Alexa.I see many have shared what I wrote as first review.  If it was a flaw, it's been fixed.  First check your settings and make sure ""Sync with Amazon Alexa"" is on.  You should at that point be able to say ""Alexa, put [item] in my [list name] shopping list.""As soon as it recognizes ""Bj's"" this rating will go to five stars."

And that the any list app and the Alexa app don’t seamlessly sync with each other. And for example if you want to add an item to your grocery list with Alexa you have to be very specific  in your wording. Whereby if you were to say “add milk to my grocery list” it will create a separate list in the Alexa app versus adding to the grocery list that already exist. If your grocery list is just called “my Grocery you actually have to say add milk to my grocery” you cannot use the word “list” otherwise it creates a new list. So it’s a good concept but it takes a little bit to get used to using it and I has a few quirks.

You can ask Alexa to add any items to any list, like “Add Milk and Cereal to Grocery List” and “Add Detergent to Costco List.”  (And yes, Alexa allows you to now add multiple items at once).And if you have Google Home, just use IFTT and make a new applet with recipe phrase “Add $ to XXXX List” for each list you want, like Target, grocery, Costco, pet store, etc.  Also make sure to link Google Assistant in IFTTT App.I prefer Alexa better since it’s smart enough to know if you already have an item on your list, and it can remove items.  Google home is a bit more limited at the moment."

I love that you can manage the 2 Alexa lists from the AnyList app. I love that my family can now, instead of asking me to remember to get something, just ask Alexa to add it to the list. I often ask them to add it to the app themselves but that extra effort just meant it never got on the list. This is a dream and definitely worth it if you are an AnyList user, and if you’re thinking about starting with AnyList, I recommend you try it.

B07BT365TX,BJ's Wholesale Club,Shopping,IhorSneutrino,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Dishonest business, rude customer service","Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2019","BJs delivered a broken dishwasher and took months to replace with new one, causing us major life inconvenience.On 9/12/2018 we ordered a ""Whirlpool Dishwasher with 1-Hour Wash Cycle - Stainless Steel"" (Item ID: 99372) from BJs online and were informed it would be delivered in early October.However, it was not delivered until late October while I was away on a business trip, at 7am on a Monday morning, with my wife receiving only 10 minutes warning by phone.The delivery person took away our old dishwasher, which was still perfectly functional, and installed the new one, which did not work. He said it was a problem with our wall wiring and left without verifying with my wife.Later that day we hired a handyman to investigate, and he concluded our wall wiring was fine and it was the dishwasher which was broken.The following week Whirlpool sent over a representative who verified the dishwasher was defective.It took another few weeks, with many frustrating calls to BJs (whose customer service agents were very cold and impolite) to finally deliver and install another functional dishwasher. By that time my wife had already been inconvenienced for almost two months -- she has a disability and cannot wash dishes by hand, so had to take our children out to eat every day.The worst part of this is that when we complained to the Better Business Bureau BJs lied that we were fully compensated for our losses. Hence I resort here to record our painful lesson: let everyone be warned BJs Online is a dishonest and broken business! Shop elsewhere!"

When I got it the csr told me there would be a 20% surcharge if I purchased anything. And I could have just walked in and looked around, no card needed to go through the door.

Now they seem more like “featured” products - because every time I see an item I want on Daily Deals - I double check for prices elsewhere and find that there is no deal. I don’t know if sellers are marking up prices and then “slashing” them to make them appear as a deal or if the product on the daily deal is far superior in some way making the original cost more...but I haven’t seen a real “deal” in quite some time. Black Friday, Amazon Prime Day, Cyber Monday...all the same thing - original price is more than other sellers - making the deal just another choice at about the same price, and in some cases, even more."

This program is very simple.  You simply say to whatever smart thing you have ""Hey ... Send Me A Sample!""  It'll bring up the program and ask you what sample you would like.  I say ""List Samples.""  It then tells me what's available, and I choose from those options.  That being said, sometimes they don't have anything they're promoting.  This is due to the fact that it's rather new and they are still acquiring companies that want to run samples through them.  I've received many samples already and it's just fun and fantastic.  Hope you take this for a spin, and get to enjoying free samples that you don't have to pay for! ;)"

Unfortunately the Skill didn't have any recommendations for ""faded jeans"" but did manage to recognize the term and repeat it back to me accurately.

Out of 5 attempts, Kit was able to make a recommendation for engine belts when I asked about toothpaste, could not make a recommendation 3 times for other common products, then finally made one accurate recommendation for a coffee maker. Unfortunately, Alexa rattled off the brand and product names very quickly. I checked my history in the app and kit provided what appears to be an amateur photo of the coffee maker without listing the brand, name, or providing any way to purchase it.

I then tried laptop and it gave me some high tech camera, and then I tried horse just to be smart and it gave me game of thrones themed coasters. Last I tried personal laptop computer thinking that's very specific and should get a more accurate result... it recommended a duffle bag. Within an hour I disabled this skill, maybe I'll try it again after some months pass and they work some bugs out"

B075T2DB1R,Listonic - smart grocery list,Shopping,skst,3.0 out of 5 stars,Great Android app but using the Alexa skill is frustrating,"Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2019","I like using the app, but the shortcomings in Alexa's ability to use the Listonic skill make it difficult for me to continue using Listonic. Alexa ignores the ""ask Listonic"" part of the voice command about half the time and adds my item to the Alexa list. (I wish there were a way for Listonic to replace Alexa's built-in lists!) I have to say the command a second or third time before Alexa finally realizes that I'm telling it to use a skill. This is the main pain-point in using Listonic. Perhaps Listonic can add another keyword to activate their skill--one that Alexa recognizes more readily.One nitpick I have is that after using a single-line voice command (e.g., , ""Alexa ask Listonic to add bread.""), the Listonic skill asks you what else you want to do, so I always have to wait for it to ask ""What do you want to do next?"" and then say, ""Stop."" Not only do I *not* want to do anything else, but it also feels unnatural to respond to, ""What else do you want to do?"" with ""Stop."" (It should also accept ""Nothing"" or ""Exit"" or, better yet, automatically exit if I haven't said, ""Open Listonic."")"
B075T2DB1R,Listonic - smart grocery list,Shopping,concreteblonde,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not impressed,"Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2018","It will only add items to ""Alexa List"". If you change the name of the list to ""Grocery"" for example , Alexa will create a new ""Alexa List"""" and add items to that. You can't create or change active lists with Alexa .  Even using the app on my phone is disappointing. It's too hard to get it to sort your items by how your favorite grocery store is laid out. I inadvertently ""delete purchased items"" trying to get it to custom sort. Once they're deleted, you can't restore them, not even from the trash in settings. I really like the ""Color Note"" app, just wish it had a link with Alexa."

Once you place an order for contact lenses from discountcontactlenses.com and enable this skill, you'll be able to quickly and easily reorder them by just asking Alexa. Note that she will read back your order number at normal reading speed... but you don't have to memorize it - you'll get an email to your registered email account shortly thereafter.I have an echo dot in my bathroom, and I can forsee opening the drawer and finding I only have one or two contacts left in the box and having my virtual butler Alexa ask Discount Contacts to reorder them instantaneously. In fact, come to think of it, I think I'll write the phrase on the box itself so I have it ready for the next order. Highly recommended."
