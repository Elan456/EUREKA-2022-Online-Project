B07C56NMQK,War Eagle,Sports,John,4.0 out of 5 stars,Amusing,"Reviewed in the United States on August 31, 2018",Plays the fight song. Unfortunately Alexa seems to want to define what an eagle is almost as many times as she wants to start the app. Also while it's playing the screen is just grey with a tiny AU at the top. A little disappointing but war eagle anyway!

B07MP52KQD,Sing Bear Down!,Sports,moodz,1.0 out of 5 stars,The Seattle fan cannot Bear Down,"Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2019","Alexa is admittedly a Seattle fan so I could understand a lack of enthusiasm for this skill but the skill is supposed to initiate by stating ""Alexa, Bear Down"" when the skill is enabled.  That phrase does not work.  Alexa says ""hmmm I don't know that one"" or gets confused and states 'it sounds like you are asking me about bear down"" and then starts to tell me about another team. Too bad. It is just good fun to have Alexa sing the fight song when your team scores against the team of all of your guests."

B07BVXSZL4,Archery Answers,Sports,go2garrett,4.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to launch and use,"Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2019","I liked how easy it was to launch and play.  The information is good but I would like to be able to pick questions to ask and so far, I don't think that is a feature.  Also, I am not a beginner archer and would like to be able to ask specific  advanced questions such as ""Explain how to determine my proper arrow length"" or ""What types of mechanical releases are available?  Which mechanical release is best for competitive target shooting?"".  This is my very first free Alexa app to load.  Very fun!  Thanks"

B075J7ZSFQ,End Zone Football,Sports,J,3.0 out of 5 stars,New features for Endzone football.,"Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2020","end zone football does not have enough features. You cannot play all of the quarters. You can only play the final quarter. Also, you cannot make any two point conversions. Also, not an extra point. I don’t like that. How can Amazon get new features for Endzone football? You can only play on offense, not defense. How can that feature be made? Also, I want to play all 4/4, but I can’t. What should I do? Well, I don’t know. Hopefully Amazon will give me feedback for this.￼￼"

B017OBGRKY,Fantasy Football,Sports,jjaquinta,3.0 out of 5 stars,More of a Football news source rather than much to do about Fantasy Football,"Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2015","This is an Echo front end to the Fantasy Football Nerd website. This uses ""Nerd Rank"" technology to crowd source ratings. They're good enough to be quotes as ""the Cliffs Notes of the Industry"" by The Washington Post in 2009.Ease of Use: 3 out of 5. It's pretty simple, you can just ask for news, or about a certain player. It was better than I expected with the player names. It did crash once, but it got all the others I tried right. When it reads the general news, it is in several segments. It can get kind of long. It would have been nice if it was split up and you could cycle through them conversationally. Player news is also in segments, but the gap between them is less clear. This can create some confusion as one news update runs into the next. Also, the text comes straight from their site, and occasionally it reads web-links, which is confusing and unhelpful.Usefulness: 3 out of 5. I know almost nothing about Fantasy Football. But this skill seems more of a Football news source rather than much to do about Fantasy Football. That's great for football fans. I don't know how great that is for Fantasy Football fans. Perhaps it should have been marketed more towards mainstream football enthusiasts.Novelty: 3 out of 5. It's another ""read the news to  you"" skill. The news appears to be high quality and relevant for the topic. But it really is just about the news.Overall: 3 out of 5. It's fairly specific in it's appeal, although, admittedly, football is rather popular. I'd like to see them add in more interaction and connect with the gameplay of Fantasy Football itself. There are several tools on the web site and I think the skill will improve greatly if they integrate those in going forward."

Still a bit buggy and takes too long to get simple questions answered. I wish they had a quick way to get you stats for a player without all the prompts. Also, It would be nice if I could ask it more concise commands like ""Is Billal Powell available in my 'X' league?"" Right now I have to wait for her to welcome me, confirm the league name I'm using and then ask her the question. Also sometimes if the player's name isn't recognized it just does the very annoying, Alexa silent fail, which you only notice if you can see the device."

I had music playing, which appropriately muted and Alexa said, “Let’s call those Hogs!,” which was actually very muddled, but I could overlook that part had the call been better. It was probably 5 notches quieter on the volume control than what I had been listening to, and I had to strain to hear it. I have my Echo Spot connected to a [very high quality] speaker (apparently we cannot use other brand names in reviews), so sufficed to say, it wasn’t the sub quality mono speaker at fault. It sounded like someone just had their tv on, recorded it on their phone from across the room, then posted it as an Alexa skill. I mean, if you’re going to post it, I’m sure UA would provide you an HD or UHD audio clip, or even better would be a video clip. That way you get to witness the spectacle of Razorback Nation as well as actually hearing it clearly. But that’s just a suggestion. At the very least, you could have a Razorback on my screen. I do like that I don’t need to stop my other skill to use it. I could be listening to the game, a commercial break comes along and I could just have an impromptu hog call-which sometimes happens!"

Jon is like the the best friend who gets just a glimpse behind the curtain. He is knowledgeable about current wrestling stars and promotions. I laugh with him, not at him when he completely mispronounces  names of 70s and 80s stars. I get it. I used to work in broadcasting. Trust me it is not easy. What impresses me most is he is does an entertaining show on many platforms. He works alone, no sponsors. He is not in a WWE Studio, he is probably using his own equipment. Also, he isn't in some wrestling mecca like Stamford, or Louisville, or Winter Park. He's is in that wonderful place called Hazzard, Kentucky.  Still i put his show up there against the big boys who have producers, writers, and staff, that make their shows so polished."

But I've finally reached my threshold. The final straw came when Jon detailed all the information relating to his wisdom tooth ordeal. I'm really sympathetic and I'm glad everything worked out in the end, but a program about wrestling news isn't the place for a looong, detailed description about an infection complete with descriptive visuals (ie ""puss""). I listen to my Echo news briefings in the AM while eating breakfast. No one wants to hear about puss and infection while eating. No thanks. If you want wrestling news in a nice condensed format on your Echo, look elsewhere."

His personal stories do come off as cries for sympathy sometimes, but we all deal with our tribulations in different ways. I’m not going to fault him for that, and sometimes it does make you feel like you know him. Your call if you mind that or not.Lately, though biases have been glaring with fave wrestling promotions and even his politics. We all have our biases so no worries. But his reviews of individual matches dont add up in his reviews of events as a whole. One promotion gets crapped on (politely) while others are overpraised based on his own reviews. Then his politics bleed into show reviews too.I subscribed for the last few years, but I’m looking for an alternative now."

We select NPR for the Flash briefing skill because the CNN Flash Briefing is almost worthless -- apparently CNN only updates it once a day.  Unfortunately, the NPR briefing does not stop when the flash briefing is complete, but continues into boring, biased commentary.  Curiously, when we tell Alexa to stop the skill, the device almost never accepts the first command, and continues to babble on.  BTW, the Fox News selection for the skill does exactly the same thing.Amazon, please fix this behavior!

B084T6PSDT,6-Minute Workout,Sports,Wizard of Boz,3.0 out of 5 stars,Instructions ambiguous,"Reviewed in the United States on March 27, 2020","The narrative wanders and is weak, has inane encouragment (it's a flipping machine!)  and fails to prepare you for the next exercise, and is ambiguous about start time.  How about 1) advanced warning of next exercise, 2) clear, uniform starting narrative, 3) clear, uniform ending narrative?  Then rinse and repeat.  EVERY exercise should be like1) ""Prepare for Jumping Jacks""2) ""Start Jumping Jacks in 5,4,3,2,1 START!""3) ""Continue jumping jacks for 5,4,3,2,1, STOP, and rest for 15 seconds""4) ""Prepare for next exercise: forward lunges""5) ""Start forward lunges in 5,4,3,2,1 START!""and so forth.So every exercise has a ""get ready"" notice 10 seconds in advance.Every exercise is started with a countdown and ""START!"", no exceptionsEvery exercise is started with a countdown and ""STOP""!, no exceptionsOther narrative ""Great job! Keep going!"" I find silly, distracting, and counterproductive.  This is a fancy timer to do a very focused workout. If it did only that, it would be terrific.  The encouragement (by an electronic device that has no idea if you've done the exercise well!) is a negative and there's no way to make it a positive."

B0735XW8LM,Running Outfit Advisor,Sports,Mark E,3.0 out of 5 stars,Interesting idea...but could be a lot better,"Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2017","I like the idea of having an Alexa skill help you figure out what to wear for a run. And this skill does do that...after some work. You basically have to tell it everything--eg male/female, temperature, kind of run, etc. and then it gives you a canned recommendation, which isn't bad. The only thing that would be really cool is if it could remember your stats, and if it could incorporate a live weather feed so that you don't have to tell it that. For example, ""Alexa, ask running outfit advisor for a recommendation for Mark in Denver Colorado today at 2pm"". If it could remember that Mark is a male and look up the weather, that would be very cool. This is a great idea that could/should be built upon. Nice start!"
