   The hubby and I love the idea of voice ordering but don’t have a Fazoli’s near us, so we were excited to try this out on a recent trip through Colorado. I’ve posted a video below if you want to see how it went.With Alexa, I’ve learned it’s best to keep things simple—use common words, speak clearly, pause for her replies and be ready to try other phrases if she doesn’t understand right way. If you watch the video, you’ll see that she did misinterpret one or two things, but it was easy to recover by choosing different words.We successfully placed an order, charged it to our card, picked up the food, ate and thoroughly enjoyed it, especially those garlic breadsticks… Oh man! So good.I do think this is bleeding-edge technology, so you need a little patience."

The one big thing it lacks is ""live"" status updates. I don't want to just know when the pizza's here -- the knock on my door tells me that. I'd like to hear that my order's being put in the oven, that it's on its way, that the driver is a few minutes away. The location near me sometimes gets INSANELY busy, and it'd be nice to have Alexa tell me when it's moving along rather than having to keep poking the app to see what's going on with my pizza.Setup and linking instructions were also a little unclear, which might make it needlessly difficult for some, but I was able to figure it out without too much hassle. Would be nice to see this process made a little simpler somehow."

To get the update of my order I have to ask Alexa to ask Dominos every time and then wait for her to ask me what phone number I used... then wait a little longer and finally the update..... but I already got the answer on my phone 2 seconds after I picked up my phone. It would be nice if Alexa could just speak the updates as they occur rather than my having to ask all the time and keep reciting the phonebook in a crowded room...

I don't always order the same thing every time, but there is a certain order I consider my ""favorite."" I have that set as my Easy Order. When I'm home and the wife isn't, I just shout to the void, ""Alexa, tell Dominos to place my Easy Order."" Then, like magic, pizza arrives at my doorstep about 20-30min later. If, for some reason, pizza has not arrived within 20min or so... I once again shout into the void, ""Alexa, ask Dominos where my pizza is."" Then the void answers back, ""It's out for delivery."" Magic. Seriously, the future is now.In seriousness, I almost gave 4 stars instead of 5 because of that limitation. It can only repeat your last order, or place your Easy Order. I can't think of a viable solution for ordering something more complicated, though. By the time Alexa walked you through which coupons, pizza, crust, and toppings you want... it would probably have been easier just to grab your phone or laptop. Maybe. What do I know. I look forward to the time when I can find out for myself."

She asked if we wanted to repeat our last order, and since we’re pretty predictable when it comes to pizza, it was super easy. However, not being able to use a coupon made the order nearly $12 more expensive and I had to call the store to ask them to apply the coupon. So much for saying us a step. Further, when talking to Alexa, there was no mention of a payment method at all, leaving us wondering if the order had been paid for with the payment method stored in our account. Turns out, it wasn’t paid for and we needed cash at the door, which luckily we were able to scrounge up."

B01B5G99CC,Domino's,Local,Justin,5.0 out of 5 stars,"... was able to get this working in a few easy steps, download the Domino's app to my phone ...","Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2016","I was able to get this working in a few easy steps, download the Domino's app to my phone from the app store. Setup an account. Place my first order. When checking out the first time, save that order as my easy order. The first order you can track by asking alexa to open domino's and select track order. The second time you order, you can select the easy order that you created the first time. If you want a special order, it is way faster to do it with the app and would be so convoluted trying to use voice selecting pepperoni yes, olive no, etc. I think the only thing that would make this better would be to be able to add a promotion coupon. Or for Alexa to say get 50% off entire order today, would you like to apply it."

B01B5G99CC,Domino's,Local,Mr Dapper,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Voice Activated Pizza Delivery System, or ALEXA for short.","Reviewed in the United States on October 11, 2016","It finally works. I have no idea why it started working, but I can now order pizza through Alexa. I didn't make any changes, just decided to try it again and it worked. It works rather well now, and you can even ask Alexa what is in the order incase you forget what it was, as well as ask where your order is...as the pizza guy can never find my house and so I have to wait outside for him. I would love to be able to set up multiple orders for different occasions. Just being able to ask for orders by a preset list created on their website would be nice. I rarely order the same thing twice in a row, so it would be nice to have some variety.(Original Post - 1star)Says I have an invalid payment method. No noticeable way to correct what works fine for paying when using any other way of buying Domino's Pizza. so until they fix it, this is a waste.(Update below-11-4-2016 - one star)I have attempted to use Alexa again to order Pizza. I redid the entire account on both Alexa and on Domino's. From there website with all the same info I can order without any issues, but from Alexa I still get a generic ""invalid Payment Error"". It doesn't explain what is wrong with my account, and calling customer service from Dominoes, they couldn't see anything wrong either.Now, payment issue aside, Alexa hears the commands without issue and attempts to order my pre-saved order that I set on Dominoes Website, but I guess I've got to get off the couch and login to the computer and order the pizza the not so old-fashion way. Will try again the next time I see an update for the app."

Not only have they made the whole process frustrating, the instructions they provide in the Alexa app for setup don't even work or match what you find on their website when you try to setup an Easy Order (if you can find it at all).If you have not previously had a ""Pizza Profile"", you can't create the profile and then establish your Easy Order preferences for a pizza(s) that you will want to order when the time comes, even though the instructions on the Alexa app indicate that you can do so.Do it right, or don't do it at all, Dominos!  And, take a lesson from Amazon: make it easy for me to give you my money.  If you don't, I'll go somewhere that does."

You're far better off using the internet browser for ordering."

B07BFHJC6W,Ticketmaster,Local,AmazonShopper,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worthless.  Absolutely horrible. Nearly impossible to select tickets.,"Reviewed in the United States on April 18, 2019","Tried to use this a few times. A) It has difficulty understanding words, particularly numbers, which is a HUGE problem when you are trying to select the quantity of tickets you want. B) It didn't let me select the price point I wanted for tickets - it defaulted to the cheapest seats which is not what I wanted.  C) During an on-sale, it would let me know what seats I requested on the App but would not actually cart them. In other words, you look at the ticket location on the app (Which only showed section and NOT row or seat number!!! - how insane is that) but the Skill had not carted them. When you say you want the tickets the skill has to 'reserve' them. During an initial on-sale, those tickets the Skill located but did not reserve will be impossible to locate again. ---In other words, it is IMPOSSIBLE to buy tickets when an event first goes on sale.  The Skill should actually cart the tickets and give you a time limit with which to complete the order as Ticketmaster does on the internet and did on the phone.This truly is a worthless product and should not have been introduced until the flaws were worked out. The concept is promising but needs fixing.Go back to offering phone sales as the automated phone system worked well.Revision May 2021: Even more worthless than before. Keeps saying I can only buy tickets if I add a credit card to my Ticketmaster account.  There is one, however.  A total glitch.  Worthless skill."

B01JFUHN0K,School Menus By Nutrislice,Local,Jeff Benjamin,2.0 out of 5 stars,Multiple schools and school names which are the same as the district name are impossible.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2016","Very difficult with names of schools that are not common easily said words. Name of school must match the name perfectly as listed, by the app or listed on the sight.More than one school can be listed, but the app exits after one listing, so you must reenter the app to get the next school.Impossible to get a menu from a school which the name of the school is also the district. Example: District name: Oakdale Area School District. Name of school Oakdale Area High School. You ask for ""Lunch tomorrow Oakdale Area High School"" - Alexa responds ""No school available called 'Area High School' in the district of Oakdale Area - For a list of schools ...."" When you are using more than one school, you have to state the each school name. In my case - options are to set you main school as the one that is difficult to say or the one she can not find because the school name is part of the district name.The developers made it so you can list any school at anytime. But that ,makes it more than difficult to get the wording perfect. Maybe more than one school could be kept, then lunch for all could be listed? Maybe short names could be used, why use the complete name of Oakdale Area High School, she knows the district you are in, if only one High School, just use ""High School"" - the app gets confused when the district and the school name are the same.I gave it my best shot, but needing to know three different school menus is more than difficult with this app. Paper copies will remain as the first choice for us. 10 minutes to maybe get three lunch menus verses a quick look at the printed menus - not a tough choice for our family.It is a neat thought, but not for a family with more than one school."

Or, you can just say, ""Alexa, open CTA Bot."" and it will give you instructions on syntax and wait for your input. Not sure how well it works if there are multiple buses.

B0758TH8KC,Avis,Local,Charles,1.0 out of 5 stars,Great if you don't care about price or most details,"Reviewed in the United States on June 28, 2019","This app epitomizes what is wrong with coding at this time.  Having a product is more important than whether the product is actually well-thought out or if it really works.  So little attention has apparently been paid to the user interface and what a real customer needs that it should be embarrassing.What if you're in a household with more than 1 person who travels and needs rental cars?  Didn't make it to the actual point of finalizing a reservation, so, maybe there's a spot in there that allows a renter change, but since it is accessing the Avis profile linked to the Alexa, I'm betting not. Guessing the only way to book for the wife is to link her Avis account to Alexa to make the reservation and then I guess unlink and relink to mine to do one for me.Unanticipated response from user cancels the entire reservation process, but the response shouldn't be unanticipated.  When Alexa asks ""when do you want to return it?"" it is apparently only wanting the date of the return because apparently return time isn't an option. Mentioning time throws the error message and closes the skill.  If you want just the date, then ask ""what day do you want to return it?""  See how easy that is?  That's what I mean by awful needs assessment for the scripting.And why is return time not an option?  If you pick it up at 10 am, it's going to reserve it until 10 am on drop-off day.  What if I'm not back to the airport until 4 that afternoon?  Who really reserves in 24-hour increments on a regular basis?No option for drop-off at a different location.Accuracy of rental location:  I said ""Baltimore Washington Airport,"" Alexa replied with ""did you mean 101 w Fayette st Baltimore MD 21201?""  ""Uh, yeah, I guess"" while I typed the address in and found out that the address is the Radisson Hotel Baltimore Downtown-Inner Harbor.  What?  How did we go from Baltimore Washington Airport to a hotel with only one of those words in its title?And finally pricing.  Booking through Alexa doesn't offer an option to prepay for the reservation and the actual price was different by a few dollars than the price that I could see online for the ""at the counter"" reservation.  No clue why.  Not sure if the Alexa price was better or if it was worse but sounded a couple of bucks lower because it wasn't telling me the price with taxes which is what I'm guessing probably was the case.Not anywhere near ready for primetime.  Basic needs have not been anticipated in any way.Don't bother with the Budget skill either because it's the same as this one, just linking to the Avis partner instead."

I got about six gift cards in the first 2-3 months, then they just stopped giving them to me.  When I called Avis (today) they said I didn't qualify for the gift cards because I was upgraded.  First, I never requested an upgrade, the give it to me EVERY TIME because of my status with the Avis program.  Second, I am 100% sure that the rentals for which I did get the gift cards included a free upgrade.So... I guess someone found a loophole and ended the perk for people who travel a lot.

After 45 minutes, NOT 20, we finally got to our car.We realize that there is a broken tail light on our car, which is also not the vehicle we asked for, so we asked one of the Avis employees. She told us” it is fine, when you drive up to leave, just tell them it was the person before you who had left it in that condition”. So we packed our car and put in the car seat the company provided us.We then drive up to hand in our info and leave, but, the employee at the window told us, “ if the car has that broken on it, you’ll have to get another car. My husband asked him to call and tell them he needed to speak to a supervisor.The supervisor didn’t show up for 15 mins, and he takes 90$ off ...WHICH ISNT EVEN HALF OF WHAT WE PAID FOR THIS SERVICE!Then, we finally get another car, an suv this time,( like we asked for from the beginning) and an avis employee parks it not in a parking spot, oh no, but I the middle of isle. So now everyone is trying to get around as we trying to pack our SECOND car.The car seat isn’t fitting, another supervisor comes over and he ACCUSES ME of putting the wrong safety strap on the car seat. He said “ This isn’t the right part for this car seat is this yours?”So now to add to the lllooonnnggg list of things,this company doesn’t even provide the proper safety strap for a car seat!Finally after TWO AND A HALF HOURS we leave.When we came to return the car to the airport we had to wait on a FIFTY MINUTE line, we almost missed our flight, we had to run with a 4 year old to catch it on time.Oh and they tried to charge us for not filling the gas tank, which we filled right before dropping it off.What a SUPER CRAP company!"

B0758TH8KC,Avis,Local,Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Questionable Tactics at Avis Rome Airport,"Reviewed in the United States on October 11, 2019","We had a very unfortunate experience with Avis in Italy. The agents at the Rome airport told us we were getting a ""special offer"" which turned out to be a sly manipulation into an upgrade. We relied on the agent to explain our contract to us in English since it was written in Italian. She assured us that due to this special promotion we would be getting a better car for less money than the car we had originally reserved. Instead - we were ultimately hit with a bill for over three times the amount of our original reservation. Our calls to Avis Car Rental about this matter have been met with rudeness and condescension despite the fact that reviews on Yelp and TripAdvisor forums show that this kind of deception happens again and again at Avis Rome Airport. The folks at @avis claim we should have known better and we should have asked for a contract in English. Not a very good excuse for their agents' questionable tactics for selling upgrades. For shame Avis."
B0758TH8KC,Avis,Local,John Marshall,1.0 out of 5 stars,VERY poor experience with this company,"Reviewed in the United States on March 24, 2020","Last November, I rented an Avis car at Sky Harbor Airport in Phoenix.  Less than a half hour after leaving the airport location I had a flat tire directly in front of an auto repair shop.  I immediately turned into the parking lot and asked if I could pay someone to change the tire for me. A manager told me would be happy to change the tire but wouldn’t think of charging me for it.Upon opening the trunk, we discovered that there was no spare tire which was the first issue. So, he brought out an air compressor to get enough air in the tire so that I could slowly drive to a satellite Avis location less than a quarter mile away. It quickly became apparent that the tire was not holding the air. In trying to determine why, he noticed that there was a large hole in the interior portion of the wheel. So, all the air being pumped into the tire was immediately coming out of the hole. Given the location of the hole it was obviously a defective wheel and not something I had done.The nearby Avis location exchanged the car which made me happy until four months later when I received a repair bill for $677.44 for damages that I did NOT cause.  Now I am decidedly UNhappy and will NEVER rent from this company again."

To get the next trip to or from a station, say something like:Alexa, ask Boston Rail for next train from Ashland to South StationAlexa, ask Boston Rail for next train to South Station from KingstonYou can also start a dialog with Boston Rail by saying:Alexa, ask Boston Rail for Departures (Alexa will then ask for the name of the station you are departing and then heading)Alexa, ask Boston Rail for Arrivals (Alexa will then ask for the name of the station you are heading and then departing)Hope this helps!Note: Since the Alexa Skill store does not currently have a way for developers to respond to reviews, I am doing so in a review.  Please pardon this approach as my only intent is to help commuter rail riders find the information they are looking for quickly and easily through this skill. To compensate, I have only given the app a 3 star rating (one up from the ""Needs to have rail schedule"" review).Sincerely,Charlie Christinacharlesjchristina@gmail.com"

However, you must suss out what station names it's looking for, and will continue to pester you that either the origin or destination location is missing. For example, it doesn't know ""Newark Penn Station"", only ""Newark"", even though it calls the station ""Newark Penn Station"" when it repeats back to you.If you get stuck in the origin/destination missing pester loop, the safe-word is ""quit"".Also, it doesn't restrict itself to PATH. If you ask for the next train from Newark to 33rd Street, it'll put you on Amtrak. That will get you there, but WAY more expensively than taking the WTC train out of Newark and then transferring to the 33rd St PATH.A nice enhancement would be to hear the next -n- departures from a particular station. But all in all, bearing in mind the limitations, it's handy."

That is where it ends. It pretty much only gives me three choices and not one of them is initially to get a ride. You would think that would be an initial choice being a ride share service. You first have to ask it to find the nearest driver. Only then does it give you the option to ""Order a lyft."" You would think the next thing would be Alexa asking something along the lines of where to or to what destination are you going? Nope. You have to open your phone's app to add that.

B01FV34BGE,Lyft,Local,Jeff Rodman,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Please take the Alexa-Lyft skill seriously, developers!","Reviewed in the United States on February 7, 2019","This skill has very limited capability and required three machines to set up (iPhone, Macbook, and Alexa itself). The target user is my wife, who has no computer or computer skills and has had to resort to GoGoGrandma phone calls to get a Lyft sometimes.  I'm an engineer and have set this all up for her, but can't be around to babysit.  It should give better feedback and fuller information, as another comment noted. Two months ago it sent the pickup two blocks away, for reasons of which I have no clue.  Think predictability and reliability, you'll be great."
B01FV34BGE,Lyft,Local,ROConsumer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Alexa Lyft App is Garbage,"Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2019","I am astonished by how horrid the Alexa skill is.  You cant enter a destination.  It does not confirm the name of your driver or when she will arrive.  There isn’t even any way to get confirmation that the ride was actually requested.  The skill always goes back to the intro, even after you have ordered a ride.  This “skill” deserves a zero, not even a one."
B01FV34BGE,Lyft,Local,Lauren,5.0 out of 5 stars,Can't link account in app? Use Alexa skills section on amazon.com,"Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2017","*Review of functionality of app belowIn app seemed to be giving me similar problems that others have stated having: not getting verification text promptly, and unable to get beyond giving my cc info (error message of ""unexpected error"" would pop up and that would be the end of it). I use Lyft to get to work constantly as I am always on call, usually only get about an hour's notice, and live close enough that it's not a huge expense to use it to at least get to work so I'm not sweaty and wind blown by the time I get there. So needless to say I wasn't opposed to doing a little detective work to get it to work, scrolled down through the comments until I finally found someone who, instead of belittling those who could not figure out how to link their account and therefore gave a bad review, actually gave a useful solution.Got out the laptop, amazon.com, departments drop down, Echo & Alexa, Alexa skills, search Lyft, link account. At this point you will have to allow the pop up that amazon is going to want to open as the ""sign in to Lyft"" page, so if you have an adblocker, you should get a little notification when you click ""link account"", which will give you the option to allow it. But I mean, if you had the wherewithal to install an adblocker, I'd imagine you'd already be privy to how to temporarily disable it/allow a one time pop up window. After that, it's just like how it wanted to work in the app, send verification text, give cc info, hit accept, account linked!*As to how well the function actually works, I tried it out and I'm as pleased as could be. I asked, ""Alexa, I need a ride from Lyft"" (you have to specify Lyft as those dirty b*stards at Uber cornered the ""I need a ride"" phrase for their app), and she informed how far away in minutes the closest driver was to my location, then asked if I'd like her to call it for me. If yes, she'll play a bit of music (seems to change every time) until you're paired. It seems that at this point the music will stop, at which point I usually get a text from the Lyft app about my driver, but Alexa will also ask if I'd like to know if the app has successfully paired me with anyone so I don't have to worry about checking it on my phone. If you say yes, she'll give you the appropriate info about the driver like name, type of car, and eta (basically the information that you get via text from Lyft). Definitely great for me when I'm scrambling to get my sh*t together, get it all together, and put it in a backpack. All my sh*t, so it's all together."

Linked to my existing account, so assume that shortcoming has been addressed.After that, it has worked perfectly. :)Update: Today it forgot that I had my home and work ""shortcuts"" set up in the app. I re-added them and am hoping it will work tomorrow. Cannot summon a ""Line"" ride without those set up.Update: No dice. Still thinks I have no home and work addresses configured. Trying the usual disable and re-enable Skill ""fix"" that most of these things seem to require from time to time...Update: Still fails, even after disabling and re-enabling the Skill. Insists I have not set up my ""shortcuts"", though I edited and re-saved them. Changing to one star as it is now unusable (at least for Lyft Line).Support asked me to (surprise) try updating the app. Did not help. Repeated all above steps as well. Same nonsense message at every turn. Useless Skill now.Update: They finally fixed it and it worked for exactly one day. Now every time I request a ride it states: ""I'm unable to process your request"". After informing support of this, they told me I should update my Android OS, which makes no sense as the app itself continues to update successfully (twice in last week) and works fine on my older OS."

Mmmmm. Multitasking. Remember in the olden days when you had to use an app on your phone to call a Lyft?Unfortunately, one of my favorite features is broken, and I can't get tech support at Lyft to acknowledge it. They barely seem to know that Alexa exists.Me: When I try to use Alexa to tip my driver, it wants to tip the wrong driver. I have to open up the app to tip the right one. This used to work.CS: So sorry! I've gone ahead and tipped the driver for you.Me: Ack! No, I tipped the driver myself already. Please reverse the tip you added. I'm saying the Alexa skill didn't tip the right driver.CS: So sorry. Can you give us your phone number? I'll make sure I credit the right account.Me: Wait. How did you add a tip earlier if you need my phone—ok, look. Forget about the tip. My problem is a bug with Lyft software. If I ride with ""Bob"" to work in the morning and then ride with ""Sue"" to home in the evening, I want to say, ""Alexa, tell Lyft to tip my driver $X"" and have it respond with, ""You want me to tip Sue $X?"" But instead, it wants to tip Bob.CS: I don't see any rides with a Bob or Sue on your account. If you can give me your phone number, I can be sure to get the right account. Who is Alexa? Is that another CS rep?Me: Ok. Look. Can you just forward this email exchange to the developers?CS: ...*sigh*"

It has a very simple function: tell me the next several trains arriving at the Concord station, heading south to the city. There's no configuration (which severely restricts the audience for this skill), but the output is so simple and exactly what I was looking for: a concise list of the next few trains with departures given in minutes from now (""trains departing in 11, 17 and 30 minutes"" for example).

Is it supposed to give you a list of all stops on a route, with the subsequent codes?  When I try it, literally nothing happens.  I'll be taking my bus tomorrow, from my usual bus stop, so I'll see if I can find the stop's code on the pole/sign.  If not, I'll just continue to use the app I have on my phone that shows GPS tracking of all buses on a map of the route.  That's probably better than what I can get off of this skill, anyway."

One bug though: I get no response when I ask about L trains. Maybe has to do with asking for a ""Manhattan-bound"" train instead of an uptown/downtown one?
