B0766625N6,Scooby Doo! Mystery Inc. Theater,Novelty & Humor,Jonathan Wise,4.0 out of 5 stars,Had to give permission like 7 times,"Reviewed in the United States on November 11, 2017","1) Launch the app to give permission2) Are you sure you want to give permissions?3) All of your children listed here will have access, are you still sure?4) Alright then, enter your password to give permission.5) Now enter the code sent to your phone to give permission.6) Great now press OK to give permission again!7) I've sent you an email confirming you've given permission.At this point, I'm pretty sure it's easier to give permission for a nuclear launch than it is to open this app... Now that we're in, the app seems kinda fun, but now I'm worried about what exactly I've given permission for. If takes 7 steps to confirm, there must have been some malicious fine print... I'll play the game, then disable the skill, just in case.Update: kids loved the game, so giving it an extra star."

B017OBZR50,The Name Game (banana-fana),Novelty & Humor,jjaquinta,1.0 out of 5 stars,Looks like something written during an Amazon Developer Day,"Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2015","Another Amazonian cranking out a skill.Ease of Use: 3 out of 5. In the past I've given full marks to trivial interfaces. I'm changing my mind now. There isn't really anything to this interface, therefore there wasn't actually any design in it. So from this skill forward I'm only giving trivial interfaces neutral marks.Ironically, this will pull this skill up.Usefulness: 1 out of 5. This does exactly what it says. It takes a name, and mangles it in some child's rhyme. The problem is that the pacing is off, much like when it reads Knock-Knock jokes (which is why my skill breaks it up!) The most fun I had with this was trying to tick Alexa into saying dirty words.Novelty: 2 out of 5. OK, so no one has done a word mangling skill before. I'm not really sure this is a bad thing. Maybe translating into pig latin is next.Overall: 1 out of 5. This looks and plays like something someone thought of and wrote during an Amazon Developer Day. It took almost no effort to do, and really doesn't achieve much."

Poole,2.0 out of 5 stars,Is this just random?,"Reviewed in the United States on September 28, 2018","I guess if you want Alexa to randomly assign chores to a list of people this would work for you. I was looking for Alexa to keep track of whose turn it actually IS to do something among my 3 kids, so it being random doesn’t work for us. I just don’t want the kids arguing every day about whose turn it is to do a specific chore (we rotate) so wish I could set up a chore rota and Alexa could keep track. This doesn’t seem to do this...and there are no instructions anywhere so I have no idea how it works or how to set it up."

From there on, it is a crapshoot to figure out what Alexa will do. Some of the time it picks a random name from the helpers list (where can I make this a recurrent weekly list for each helper??), another time ""Sorry, I'm not sure"". The next time ""Table wear are dishes, …"" then goes on some random rant about completely useless information about the restaurant industry. Then ""Hmmm, I don't know that one"". Really?? And I got an email today from Amazon touting the benefits of the ""Whose turn"" app. Shouldn't you guys make sure it works before mass-emailing your customers about an app (with a great potential) that does not work?"

I just got a message back saying that that name was not on my list. it's also really annoying that I have to tell Alexa to open it before I can use it.

I tried to remove these names and it keeps saying, “Turn is not in your list of people, “ or “Apple is not in your list of people.” Therefore I can not edit the list to select from. It is also a random selection. It keeps selecting the same child over and over. It doesn’t switch turns often and is ” NOT FAIR” - Just ask my kid.

Manny was Mandy and Naya was Noella (smh). I tried multiple times but this would not recognize their names when trying to add helpers. Also their names are on my Alexa/Amazon app but it still doesn't know. I guess if your kids have general names this will work fine. It's a shame it didnt work. Every time i asked to access the skill Alexa kept saying we, ""needed mediation"" whatever that means. This was after I accepted her names for my children. Hassle to try to set up.

I’ll ask for Shaq to tell me the weather and next thing you know, Alexa is introducing me to him.  This happens on the same device frequently and ruins the moment.  The celeb voices are really for show and when they work, it’s hilarious.  Try asking Samuel to “say what again”.  Ha ha. Anyhow, Shaq hardly works and when he does, he’s kinda on the boring side."

I don't think the price was worth it as I wouldn't mind trying the other voices just to see how it goes, especially if they have a samuel L Jackson one. Oh, I do wanna point out, Shaq doesn't have a response for everything, sometimes, well, a lot of times Alexa picks up where Shaq can't respond. That sucks if I am paying for a service.  I'm not saying it's bad, just I guess it's something I would just use for showing off to friends and that's it."

Too bad Amazon deliberately blocks from most devices,"Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2022","It is beyond disappointing how Amazon continues to block newer features from customers with existing legacy devices that are a few years older.  This is just a voice, which would work on any Alexa device. Constantly forcing users to upgrade to Alexa devices which many are so dysfunctional as to be unusable.  Several lenovo devices that were sold with built-in Alexa have had all of the best features stripped away with each update thanks to Amazon's greed.Purchased specifically to use with ring doorbells and cameras, within a few months forced updates removed and blocked this and many of the better capabilities, reducing the built-in Alexa to a to a basic, near useless device.  What a joke and disappointment, This mammoth billionaire dupes and manipulates their customers and 3rd party vendors. No customer loyalty."

B089NGHR7K,Samuel L. Jackson–celebrity personality for Alexa,Novelty & Humor,Gully176,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazon promised us Celebrity Voices on our Echo, what they gave us is a poor skill","Reviewed in the United States on December 16, 2019","Amazon marketed this as a way to replace Alexa's voice with Samuel L Jackson's. What you get is a skill for Alexa that makes you sound like someone who is mad at someone in the same room. Example, ""Alexa, Ask Sam what the weather is like"". Then you get a Samuel L Jackson Response, He doesn't answer everything, and otherwise you're stuck with Alexa. I wanted a customized voice for my assistant full time, not a quirky skill that says curse words every now and again. Worst waste of a dollar i've ever spent."
B089NGHR7K,Samuel L.

There isn't. You have to ask Alexa to ask Samuel everything. I was under the impression I could have Alexa speak to me in Samuel's voice rather than the female voice we currently have. Nope, only if I ask Alexa to ask Samuel. Who wants to add more steps than you already have to take to get a response. I don't get it. For free, maybe try it, but not purchase."

Useless party trick.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 16, 2019","I'm not sure who at Amazon decided this was a good idea. It's not even worth a dollar. The implementation of a voice as a skill limits what the voice can do and means you have to use a completely unnatural syntax in order to interact with the voice. If Amazon is going to implement celebrity voices, they need to become the default voice for the unit."

Just was hoping Sam would ""replace"" Alexa's voice","Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2019","First off, I really enjoy the new skill.  It is pretty fun.  The reason I gave it a 3 star is because i was hoping and expecting something, well a little different. It seems that the skill is a glorified interview with Sam.

At least not anything that I needed so far. Idk what people are talking about when they say they have to.My only complaint is that you have to say ""Hey, Samuel"" instead of just ""Samuel"" to get any response, but if you just say ""Alexa"" that works. The two voices work side by side also. No need to say Alexa enable Samuel once its activated. Just say whatever voice you want to hear. As far as I can tell this IS a full voice replacement for Alexa."

Love it!,"Reviewed in the United States on March 23, 2020","I'll be honest, my Alexa stays pretty simple. I ask the weather. I put on thunderstorm sounds to read by. I enjoy Amazon Music Unlimited while I'm cooking in the kitchen. But THIS... this has jazzed up my Echo Show quite a bit.I started out by asking Sam for the weather, and he started out with ""Lemme look out the window and see..."" then he told me the weather for my specific little town, *by name*, and - just as Alexa does, asked me did I want the extended forecast. The whole thing was *seamless*. Literally like the venerable Mr. Jackson is hanging out right there in your Echo, waiting to assist. (Lol.)When you first open the app, Alexa offers you the choice of the censored or uncensored version. I applaud that. Use Sam responsibly, folks. Me, I'm a single guy with a somewhat naive Pomeranian, so I opted for the uncensored version.Since then, he's told me jokes, and I've explored other fun features. Just a fantastic skill. If you like his work, by all means, get it right f*&^%n' now. (Note: I've yet to actually hear any *real* profanity from this skill, I don't want to give you the wrong impression.)PS - Mr. Jackson, I just hope you see this - I want you to know I can tell you worked *hard* on this! Lots of thanks and praise for your work here!Now, Amazon... let's get moving with that Morgan Freeman voice skill!"

Thus meaning you use it like 3 times then get tired of it and never use it again. He wont say any explicit words and even said his favorite word was ""love"".... knowing dang well his favorite word ,and the one he's most well known for, rhymes with mothertrucker. This would be OK at best if it was free (yea it's only a buck but still). If they do it as an actual replacement for the original alexa voice it would be awesome, but also as is I'll never use it again which means it was a 100% waste at this point. I was really excited for this but yet again developers let us down. Maybe they will do the right thing and take it back to the drawing board due to the overwhelming bad reviews but I doubt it because they don't listen to their patrons."

Jackson you are mistaken.  I couldn't wait to hear Sam YELLING obscenity laden responses at me, only to find that what you actually get is the most toned down boring Samuel you will ever hear.  This is what you would get if you gave the real Samuel a lobotomy.  In desperation I asked Sam to say something explicit, knowing that I had enabled explicit responses in the Alexa App.  His only response is something about the versatility of the F word.  Ask again and you get the same response.  Ask Sam for a joke and you only get the usual Alexa jokes, which are worse than any Dad jokes ever conceived.  I was looking forward to making my family laugh with this, but it's not even novel enough to bother mentioning to them.  It will never get used.Though it might be unfunny, it might actually be a little useful if you could change Alexa's voice and perhaps even the trigger word to Sam...but no.  It's just a skill that requires you to invoke it using a command.""Alexa, ask Sam to..."".Amazon you really disappointed me on this.

Right now I'm waiting for my husband to get home so I can make Sam say something to surprise him. For me, the explicit version was the way to go, but if you like it squeaky clean you can set it that way as well. So you can still have Nick Fury's voice on this if you have little kids around at your house.He can read you the weather forecast and some other stuff like that. You can give Sam commands in ways like ""Alexa, ask Sam to turn on light."" And Sam will say ""OK,"" and turn on the light. So he doesn't replace Alexa, and the commands get a little more cumbersome. You're not going to say that stuff all the time, especially at the end of the day when you want to just turn everything off and get to bed.This is more for playing around with friends rather than every day things. It's a novelty, not a must-have. I would recommend it for Marvel fans, and fans of Samuel L. Jackson or people who are really into movies he's been in. Three and a half stars."

If this was a free skill I would not complain, but they are going to be asking $5 a month for this! They made it appear by the videos and advertising for this that it was a baked in skill from Amazon, but it is not. Its the same as if you had any third party skill that you wanted to use, where you have to ask alexa to ask that skill to then as your question. NOT WORTH IT.  I should be able to just say "" Alexa what's the weather?"" and since I have the celebrity voice enabled IN ALEXA'S SETTINGS Sam Jackson should automatically respond. So this is just to let everyone know, don't get me wrong yes its cool, but not worth what they will be charging after the first month of .99 cents. it is NOT worth the $5 they will be charging a month after.

A name and more enjoyable voice that will be the wake up word for Echo, for me to ask questions, that will be ANSWERED, KNOWLEDGABLY, by Mr. Jackson's voice. What it is, however, is a name/voice where I have to say, ""Hey Samuel"", fully every time, instead of just ""Hey Sam"", ""Samuel"", or more simply, just ""Sam"", (if Mr. Jackson prefers his voice to be addressed as ""Samuel"" as opposed to the shorter version, ""Sam"", I can respect THAT preference, or EVEN saying, ""Mr. Jackson"". It's just too much with the ""hey"" having to be said, as well as ""Samuel""). Especially considering that I only had to say, ""Alexa"" as the wake up word, before this voice was offered to me.Not only that, but the ""Hey Samuel"" voice is VERY limited in what ""Hey Samuel"" can actually answer or say. I know, I know, the limitations were explained before purchase. Still, I was expecting more than THIS.Most times the ""Alexa"" voice cuts in and answers for ""Hey Samuel"". While the ""Hey Samuel"" voice will say, ""I don't have an answer for that"". Also, in answering questions, not only does ""Alexa"" voice cut off the ""Hey Samuel"" voice that I initiated the wake up with, sometimes, the ""Hey Samuel"" voice will cut off his OWN ""Hey Samuel"" voice or my question, by saying WHAT I SHOULD be asking the ""Hey Samuel"" voice, BEFORE I even ask a question. These actions are quite irritating.Also, the ""Hey Samuel"" voice jokes are VERY lame. Not really jokes, at all.Amazon, please give The People a REAL CHOICE of ENTIRELY REPLACING the ""Alexa"" voice with the celebrity voice, or whatever voice, of THEIR OWN choosing? Maybe you can give more choices to choose from? And make the wake up word short & simple, like ""SAM"" or as I mentioned, the other above choices for Samuel L. Jackson. Or whoever.It's not that I don't like or appreciate the ""Alexa"" voice, I was just prepared for a complete change from the same voice I have been hearing for about 4 years now.I do LIKE the Samuel L. Jackson voice. I just believe how it responds can be much improved on.Thank you,G. Townsend"

While he does occasionally drop profanities, they are few and far between and when they are weather related they sound out of context because voice infliction and tone are off. I mean this is Samuel L. Jackson... where is the ""D$%# , its cold out Mo$^&% @@#%%^^!""?

Jackson. I am sure that most purchased this voice for that same reason, and their expectations were dashed aside with the reality of this skill.At the time of this writing, the skill is an underdeveloped mess, not meeting the basic expectations of any buyer as shown by reviews you will certainly see. It needs the following improvements to merit a more solid 3-4 star rating:1) Full Alexa integration. Though it may not have been advertised, this voice should be able to nearly fully replace Alexa's standard voice, or at least respond to the extent of its programming with more simpler context like ""Sam"" or whatever one might set it to. It is otherwise at least a little misleading, as others have said.2) More appropriate utilization of Sam Jackson's voice. Whether it was poor coding or not, his voice is not natural and not prepared to be delivered as a product as it has been.3) Functionality should match expectations. When you select ""mature content allowed,"" you certainly should expect the content which is delivered to you to merit that rating. In my usage of this skill, I rarely come across a single explicit word, which promptly defeats the premise of having Sam Jackson as an Alexa skill. Developers, do you know who Sam Jackson is? When we download this skill, activate it, enable explicit mode and demo it with a smile and excitement for the first time, how sincerely you have let us down when he responds in his abnormally robotic tone, simply, with the weather. ""Today it is cloudy."" This is self explanatory and unsatisfactory.In conclusion, much like my first trip to China from the USA back in 2013, this is very ""under construction,"" though I have no confidence that the developers intend to continue updating or producing for this product. I cannot imagine anyone paying 5$ for it, and am happy that I only had to pay 0.99$. Sorry to see such a waste of potential humor and entertainment."

Martin,2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointing,"Reviewed in the United States on December 12, 2019","The concept is exquisite, but the execution is severely lacking.  I was hoping that Samuel L. Jackson would become the default voice of my Alexa devices, lending his iconic badassery to every interaction.  In reality, you have to phrase your initial prompts in a clunky manner, i.e. ""Alexa, ask Samuel L. Jackson to tell me the weather.""  The number of things that Sam can say and do are conspicuously limited.  In most cases, Sam's robotic voice sounds stilted and highly un-Samuel-L-Jacksonlike, especially when he replies, ""No one knows the answer to that.""

While this seems like a great idea, the execution is flawed, hopefully they'll add more to it or make it more user friendly. You have to first ask Alexa to ask SLJ to do things every single time you want to hear his voice, which is redundant & stupid. Would be much better if it had all the functionality of Alexa & could replace her voice entirely, but no such luck. Also, mine is on ""explicit"" mode & it has not cursed once, not at all."

However, it is super funny and awesome. We used him to play some games as well. He didn’t integrate over to everything, which is the reason I couldn’t give a full 5 stars. It just does not flow smoothly to go from Samuel Jackson to Alexa😄.I’m not certain why some have stated that they are unable to to say, “Hey, Samuel...” without the need to say, “Hey Alexa...” considering it is working for me just fine. I am using it on my Echo 3 (with clock) and I just say, “Hey Samuel” and off he goes.The voice is his and clear. Alexa will help you set him up once you purchase the voice. He will then proceed to ask you if you are ok with the vulgarity in his speaking. It is a quick 2 minute or less process. The skill was automatically turned on when I purchased it. Therefore, there is no need to go into the app to turn it on. Unless, of course, if you experience a problem and for some reason it didn’t automatically do this for you. I only have him installed on one device in my office since I have children lol. Fun Fact: Did you know Samuel Jackson actually had a stutter from childhood which caused him to use “MF’er” in order to get his speaking back on track?"

B089NGHR7K,Samuel L. Jackson–celebrity personality for Alexa,Novelty & Humor,Kevin Bender,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Good Idea, Flawed Execution","Reviewed in the United States on April 18, 2021","I initially viewed this skill as a solution to a problem I have with two Alexa devices that're in very close proximity to one another and need to share a wake word only some of the time. It's nice having ""Hey, Samuel"" only work on devices you specifically activate it on.That's probably where the positives end.Samuel does a decent job of explaining how to customize the skill. Unfortunately, the settings are buried further in the app than I'd like, and it'd be nice if you could access some of them with voice commands.For example, I figured I made a mistake by allowing Samuel to use profanity, as he just had something to say after every single command I'd give him. I asked him to turn profanity off, and he turned on a filter that prevented explicit music from playing. Why? Even worse, I couldn't turn that filter off with a voice command, so I had to find that separate setting before digging around to figure out how to disable Samuel's profanity.Unfortunately, disabling his profanity just made him not swear during the extra statements. Stop making these assistants so talkative.Anyway, getting back to the wake word workaround, I mostly want two devices to potentially respond to the same commands, but I always want alarms on my Echo Plus, as my Fire TV Cube isn't nearly as loud and may end up trying to play alarm sounds through my TV speaker, despite not being on that TV input. So, I figured I'd use Samuel to set alarms more easily on my Echo Plus by only using Samuel on my Echo Plus.At no point does Samuel warn you that his alarms don't use your usual alarm sound. Nah, it's Samuel L. Jackson, yelling at you to wake up. Here's the thing: I live alone. I'm used to waking up with no one else in my apartment, and I'm certainly NOT used to being yelled at by anyone to wake up. If anything, in the rare case that I sleep in, maybe someone calls me. Imagine the brief moment of panic as I'm woken up by Samuel L. Jackson yelling at me. It certainly woke me up, but man...to say that I was startled is a bit of an understatement.In short, make Samuel less chatty. He doesn't need to say something witty after he acknowledges that he did what you asked him to. And he really needs to give you an option to use your regular alarm sound the first time you ask him to set an alarm (and the first time you ask him to set an alarm once such a fix has been implemented)."

The ""alexa ask Samuel....."" is too long to want to use on a regular basis.  Speech is slower than Sam actually speaks (I'm sure AI will improve this function in the future) & not to mentioned not Sam's usual potty mouth.  I would prefer to just have Sam's voice instead of Alexa.  I think that's what most people thought that's what this product was & it is NOT.  Maybe Amazon just need to come up w/ some new great voice choices + I would prefer to rename my Alexa w/ something that is 1 syllable."

We are enjoying the heck out of this new feature.  The price point is very reasonable for what you get.  ""Hey Samuel"" is his wake word, regardless of what the description says, so you don't have to ask Alexa anything other than to turn on the skill.  Samuel will give you your notifications, the weather, information, and he'll swear at you.  It's perfect.  He will politely inform you when he can't do some things, but then will often just hand it off to Alexa.  I hope this is successful, and I hope they add more voices down the road.  Morgan Freeman would be great.  Shatner would be good as well.  All in all, a great value, a lot of fun and gives you options to talk to either Alexa or Samuel.  Well done, whomever came up with the idea.  And thank you Samuel, for doing the project.  A perfect first entry into celebrity voices for the Echo."

It's extremely convenient to turn lights on and off, turn up the heat etc.When I first heard about Samuel L. Jackson being a celebrity voice for Alexa, I knew I was going to pay for it...heck, I would have paid much more than I did to have SLJ talk instead of Alexa's voice...but this implementation falls hard and fast right on its' face.  You'd THINK that you'd be able to change Alexa's voice to use SLJ instead...nope!  What you do get is this:Alexa ASK Samuel what time it is?Alexa ASK Samuel to tell me a joke.Alexa ASK Samuel...Now, this is clunky...it reminds me very much of the smart oil gauge that I have on my oil tank.  I have to say ""Alexa, Ask smart oil gauge how much oil is in the tank.""  That's poor integration...but what's worse is the majority of the time it doesn't even work.  I'll say ""Alexa, ask Samuel what time it is?"" and I'll get a response from Alexa saying ""It's 5 o clock"" or whatever time it is.It's not as though this is really expensive but it's a huge let down...huge huge huge letdown."

I don't know, but I'm not kidding, I just don't find it worth it once the novelty wore off.  The very first time I asked him, he responded like, ""I'll tell you the m***********g time!"" and I was like, ""Ha! That Samuel is cool.""  But since that one time, he seems as bored by it as I am.  Now he's just like, ""The time is six twenty-three a.m.""  OK, I'm lying, I NEVER get up that early.Will Samuel do more than the time and weather?  I dunno.  I haven't discovered anything, and I'm just not interested enough to Google it.  Though I guess I'll spend even more time than that would take writing a ""meh"" review of it.  And so now you're going to post a comment about all the cool stuff he'll do, aren't you?  Thanks.  But I don't hang around Amazon all day looking at comments, bro.

No.You have to ask Alexa to ask Samuel L Jackson to say things, which isn't ideal, but it's toreable and gets a few laughs. Telling you the weather, jokes, and etc. Just to here him say my city is cool in itself, and crack a joke here when asked is cool.Alexa is making all of our lives easier.

I have 4 Alexa devices in my Smart Home and they all have issues. Ever heard of planned obsolescence? I regret buying Alexa products and this was just a final slap in the face."

Simply that it will AT SOME POINT.To use Sam's voice, you have to first ask Alexa/Echo, ""Ask Sam (Samuel) *blank*"".  It quickly becomes a tedious ""through the grape vine"" conversation, like drama in high school. This may seem extreme, but if using Alexa/Sam frequently, you'll see how it can become a pain. He has a surprising amount of recorded lines and phrases, but trying to use explicit responses is difficult to maneuver."

Martinez,5.0 out of 5 stars,"after reading others reviews, works better than I expected","Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2021","Happy with my purchase today 4/27/2021.  Instead of using ""Alexa"" as the wake word, I use ""Hey Samuel"".Every response has Samuel L Jacksons (SLJ) voice. Some of the phrases are completely pre recorded (which sound great) and are inserted before Alexa's standard reply's. Like when I ask for the weather, he said: ""aright, I'll look outside for you"" and continue with the standard ""The weather in  _____ is ___ degrees. expect sun..."".As expected, people's names and other user specific phrases are a bit stuttered, similar to other computer generated voices, but its still SLJ voice.  Overall, I think its totally worth the couple bucks  to add it to any of my Alexa(s)Note; At any time you can use your regular wake word (alexa, computer, or amazon) to hear the standard alexa voice responses. Its great easter egg for those who are use-to/prefer alexas standard voice."

A little disappointed about that, he actually rarely says a bad word. I also thought you would be talking to him instead of Alexa. Now it's just an extra step to ask Alexa to follow something if you want to hear his voice. You have to say Alexa, ask Sam to tell me the weather, for example. It just seems like a lot of work to get a answer and I forget to do it so unfortunately I'm not really using this feature. I'm a little bummed I was pretty excited to be able to talk to Sam Jackson and get some of his profanity at the same time. Not worth it in my opinion.

My Echo Dot still answers to ""Alexa"". But it also answers to ""hey Samuel"". And Sam Jackson can do everything that Alexa does. He turns on my lights. He turns off entire rooms.. He turns on & off my TV. He tells me the weather forecast. And if you ask him to tell a joke, he's always got a good one. You can have him be vulgar, or turn that off if you have kids or don't want to hear swers. But if you do like swears, than ask him what his net worth is.. Lol. In fact as him personal questions. He'll answer. And don't even get him started on snakes on a plane.. Lol. I highly recommend this. No longer have to say Alexa & Sam Jackson makes everything sound cooler. Even if he's just saying ""okay"" after you ask him to shut a light off."

After all, it's Samuel L. Jackson. Is it easy to use? Sure. It's almost the same as using Alexa. The problem is, that I have to ask Alexa to ask Sam. That's not only ridiculous, but a waste of time and talking. I should be able to *switch* to SLJ's voice and speak directly, not ask Alexa to ask Sam. That's totally lame.So, it is easy to use, just a bit inefficient with the extra step of having to ask Alexa to ask. I consider it a value, because I only paid 99 cents. The integration is not good because of the extra step.So, bottom line, am I sorry I bought this? Not really. It was only 99 cents and I like having SLJ's voice respond.Will I buy any other voices in the future? No. Not unless they change the interaction and I can speak directly without having to ask Alexa first.I gave it three stars because it's a clever idea. In theory, I would give it a 5 just for SLJ's voice, but then Amazon wouldn't know that it's not what it could be."

And if he does he will just refer to Alexa asking her the question I originally asked.

Jackson is probable the first one you could think of wanting - along with Morgan Freeman or James Earl Jones.  For 0.99 cents, it's a no-brainer.  I do wish you had the ability to have it just respond instead of having to ""ask Sam Jackson..."", but I believe that's a limitation of how the skill is implemented, at least for now.  The biggest disappointment is the lack of explicit content, even when enabling it.  I think anyone adding Sam Jackson as a voice also wants to hear his infamous explicit flair.  But I've only heard spotty things once or twice, so it's really not that bad.  I could understand toning it down if this was the default voice for Alexa, but since I need to ask Alexa to ""ask Sam Jackson..."" every time, I think it's pretty obvious that I want explicit answers.All that said, it's a fun addition and I see it as only the beginning of the continued evolution of Alexa's possibilities."

The one in the master bedroom uses Sammy, the one in the master bathroom his Alexa.  Living Room is Sammy, Dining Room that is open to the living room is Alexa.  It's working out much better.

It’s not always as easy to use since some of the features you still have to ask Alexa to ask Samuel something - but it’s still fun.  I like that the skill has a filtered language option since I have young kids.I feel like the jokes/roasts are kind of bad, at least in the kid-friendly mode, not sure about the adult-language mode.  Not even dad joke bad (I love dad jokes), but just - not funny.  I would love to have better jokes and quotes from this celebrity voice.All in all, it’s $5, it makes me smile when I use it, it’s always good for a few laughs when we have visitors over, so yeah - I would buy it again :)"

Only reason I'm not giving it five stars is it is compatible with many of my early Echo devices, and I need to say ""Alexa, ask Samuel to tell me the weather,"" rather than just saying ""Hey Samuel, what's the weather.""  It's not compatible with my gen 1 echo, my gen 2 dot, or my fire TV Cube. But it is compatible with my Spot, that I use as my bedroom clock. And it is fun to have Samuel Jackson say goodnight to me on a daily basis.  I'd give it 5 stars if ""Hey Samuel"" worked on more of my echo devices without having to say ""Alexa, ask Samuel to..."""

However, no matter what version of Sam you get, you have to ask Alexa to ask Sam  whatever it is you need help with. For example, ""Alexa, ask Sam Jackson what the date is"" and then you get a response in his name. If you ask a second time, you'd expect him to say something like, ""B** please, you just asked me that."" Sadly, this is not the app you are looking for."

Having to remember to say ""Alexa ask Sam"" or ""Alexa ask Samuel Jackson"" for anything you want from the new voice is quite annoying. It's not even a good party trick since the change in syntax is an immediate tip off to guests. If I could get my dollar back from this purchase I would. This skill is not even worth that small sum. If Amazon is going to implement paid celebrity voices, they need to implement them as true Alexa voices that become the default voice for the unit."

Or Ask Alexa top ASK SLJ what the weather is.  This is an irresponsible use of one of America's greatest voices, and talents. I am glad it is for charity, at least I hope it is because it is an absolutely ridiculous way to try to integrate another voice to Alexa.ALSO, BY THE WAY: At what secret meeting was it decided to only let ""Personal Assistants"" use their specific names? What are you trying to imply? By completely removing any way to use a different ""Wake Word"" (That's what it is , essentially), you make me curious as to why ALL manufacturers that I know of, all adhere to this policy.Where does that Order come from? Who made that Rule? Is it being regulated in a way that the public is unaware of essentially? The FCC? I would like to understand what stands in the way of all that Big Money to be made."

Mostly works just like it’s supposed to on a second generation or higher echo device,"Reviewed in the United States on July 6, 2021",I love having the Samuel Jackson available. But it’s only good if you have a second generation or higher Eco product. It’s worthless on the first generation or on your television or your thermostat or other device. The Voice is great.  Some of it is real some of it is synthesized I guess. But it’s very believable.  Where it stumbles a bit is some of the responses to questions don’t make sense. I prefer the explicit version and I was having difficulty sometimes with Samuel Jackson giving me a boring clean version. But for the most part this is really fun. It doesn’t cost a lot of money and I just sort of wish they would do other celebrities as well.

You can also ask Sam about the weather and some other things. If you ask Sam a question he cannot answer, you will get, ""I don't know that one"".

You have to ask Alexa to get him to tell you a joke, the weather, etc. You can't just say ""Alexa show me camera 2"" or ""Alexa turn out my light"" and hear Sam Jackson's smart mouth saying something where she would say ""Ok."" You have to say ""Alexa, have Sam Jackson tell me the weather."" I'd give it five stars if I could replace the Alexa voice at all times. In fact, I have several Amazon devices and I'd love to be able to address them each with their own celebrity name and voice but it doesn't work that way. I think most people were expecting a replacement of the existing voice. That's just not the case. He's considered supplemental entertainment and not the voice of the AI. Maybe in the future. I'd love to have the James Earl Jones voice at the front door and Sam Jackson in my study. Maybe some day."

Don't care about asking personal questions about his life.

You can have it set for clean language only but what’s the fun in that?) One thing I hope Amazon will enhance is having routines run in Samuel’s voice which you cannot not do today (Turn on light, etc.). And just to be clear, you do not have to say “Alexa” first to invoke Samuel’s voice. You can ask him directly. Easy to set-up.. when you purchase, then just say “Alexa, introduce me to Samuel L Jackson” and then Samuel will come on. Give it like 30 mins afterward before asking questions for the syncing.

With all the hype, I guess I just expected him to be more himself, or more so the roles he played. Asked him about “snakes on the plane” and he went on and on about snakes and how they wouldn’t last at that altitude....sounded more like Wikipedia than Sam.

It only works about 1/3 of the time.  The results are so inconsistent that you never really know what actually works and what doesn't.  To get Alexa to switch to Samuel L. Jackson's voice is an annoying and should be an unnecessary process.I was hoping it would replace Alexa's voice with Samuel L. Jackson's.

B089NGHR7K,Samuel L.

Jackson's voice to come out of my Alexa, I thought it must be too good to be true. But, after a few mouse clicks, my Alexa has suddenly learned to skillfully use profanity along with all sorts of other colorful language! (Relax, Karen, you can easily turn off the more colorful language if that doesn't suit you.)My entire family loves having our new favorite adjunct family member Sam Jackson answer even the most mundane questions, and even gives us inspirational pep-talks if the situation warrants it. (""Alexa, ask Samuel L. Jackson 'Where's my super suit?'"" Sam: ""You don't NEED a Super Suit to be Incredible."") And, he's SO polite, too! (""Alexa, tell Samuel L. Jackson 'thank you'."" Sam: ""My pleasure!"")Frankly, even though he's only been with us a few days, I struggle to remember what life was like before Sam came. Click the ""Buy"" button right away. You need more of this in your life...no matter who you are.(Note:  My original draft of this review was deemed ""unacceptable"" by Amazon, since I actually specified some of the more colorful words Samuel L. Jackson says, redacted with asterisks over the middle part of the word.  If seeing such language in a review would offend you, I would recommend turning OFF the colorful language.  It's easy to do in the Alexa app, and you might save yourself from distress.)"

Also, you can't just have Alexa use his voice or directly ask him things. You have to ask Alexa to ask Sam. It is pretty cumbersome in terms of conversation. ""Alexa, ask Sam for the weekend weather"" just doesn't roll off the tongue.I got this for 99 cents or so as a promo when it first came out. I feel a little jipped at having paid that much. I'd be pretty ticked off if I had paid the $4.99 or so it said it would eventually cost.When I asked Sam about the Royale with Cheese, he told me gave me a definition of a royal family.When I asked him to recite Ezekiel 25:17, he spouted it off quickly and without feeling.When I asked him his ""duty"" he said it is ""to make this amusing.""The only amusing thing I have found is that he sometimes have a Sam-sounding joke... and even that is hit or miss."

So this is an extra part in the initial command and not really a replacement for Alexa's voice. After the initial novelty wore off (about a week), I stopped using it. There is an option to opt out of explicit language, and since we have no children in the house, I chose not to. I have never heard any salty talk from Sam Jackson on my Alexa. It's a waste of time."

You have to ask Alexa to ask Sam to do stuff... i.e.. ""Alexa, ask Sam to give me the weather.""  Why can't you just ask Sam directly???  i.e.. ""Sam give me the weather.""  Why would anybody go through the trouble. Also, most commands are beyond it's capability, so when you ask Alexa to ask Sam to do something, chances are you'll get Sam telling you he's useless.

A lot of users are buying into this thinking that this will actually ""change"" Alexa's normal voice, however that isn't true. This ""adds"" the ability to ""also"" use Mr. Jackson's voice (in addition to Alexa's normal voice). You have to ask Alexa ""Hey Alexa, ask Samuel Jackson for the weather"".  However, if you simply talk to Alexa like you would normally, you will get Alexa's normal voice in return. So this is nothing more than a skill you trigger with specific words (""ask Samuel Jackson...""). Thankfully, we walked into this knowing exactly what it was, so we had a lot of fun with it. However in the end, that's all it was. A fun trick until everyone got bored with it. Now, if you could replace Alexa's normal voice with it (like some of the TomTom options of the past), that would earn a solid five stars."

B089NGHR7K,Samuel L.

Instead it's an add on that Alexa can control, but you have to ask Alexa to ask Samuel for information.  I was really hoping I could change the normal Alexa voice to Sam's voice and have it tell me the weather, not ""Alexa, ask Samuel what the weather is going to be today"".  Really disappointing.  As far as functionality, it works the way it's supposed to..I guess.  I really wish I had read the reviews before purchasing, because I'm most likely not going to use this.  As trivial as it may seem, having to add the extra step in my morning routine to have Samuel Jackson tell me the weather forecast just isn't something I'm going do."

One of them typically ""hears"" my requests and half the time it tell me I have to buy the voice. Why? Because the Dot, which is in my name and configured by my phone, somehow switches to my wife's account. What is my wife's ""account""? And why does it switch? And why does that even matter when it comes to the voice? I switch the ""account"" over, but it somehow switches back. It's very frustrating. So I've had to disable the microphone on that device so that the device 3ft to the left listens. For some inexplicable reason, that one never switches accounts. Very disappointing."

There is a setting for no profanity which I left off as that's part of his acting character, but I hear nothing, so no clue why they have that setting.

Alexa seems to be very jealous and refuses to allow anyone else to have access to her capabilities! If Amazon is going to allow the use of a different voice for the Alexa app then just do that and not have to use some kind of work around such as asking Alexa to ask Samuel to answer my questions. Pushing something forward before it is ready for the sake of profits only diminishes your credibility and future interest in your products. Its all about trust!

Not only is the speech clear, and capable, but he will answer ""personal"" questions about his life and work.Now, if only they had Christoper Walken!"

The ability to have other voices to use is one thing I believe the Alexa system has been lacking. Granted this feature does not interact with all the capabilities of Alexa but it is still a very welcomed step towards it. I wouldnt think the full featured possability would be terribly difficult to incorporate minus of coarse the voice actor spending a LOT of time recording responses and sounds.

I also have his voice on the 2nd Generation Fire TV Cube and the experience on that device is much different.On the Echo Show 8, his voice completely replaces that of Alexa.  I can just say, ""Hey Samuel"" rather than ""Alexa.""  It is much easier for me to understand his voice rather than Alexa's so I will definitely continue to use his voice long after the novelty wears off.Not so on the Fire TV Cube where I still need to go through Alexa to get to Samuel as many of the other reviews have pointed out.  I've already stopped using his voice on the Fire TV Cube.  Hopefully they'll port the full experience over the Fire TV Cube.  If that happens, it is well worth the purchase."

So if you have multiple people in the household with different accounts you need to jump through hoops or listen to the intro EVERY TIME.  Alexa is frustrating enough trying to adapt to commands.

Sometimes you get the response you would expect from him, as long as you have the explicit filter turned off. I still think it's work the 99 cents introductory price (no idea what the full price will be).

On top of that, unless you use a scripted question for Samuel, you are not likely to hear his voice at all. I gave it a five star rating on accuracy due to it actually being Samuel Jackson's voice. Alexa is so frustrating to use as I see it. I am so tired of hearing ""Sorry, I don't know that one"" or ""Sorry, I don't know how to do that"" with this device.

However they plugged his voice into her horrible diction and it just doesn’t work. And where is the Sam Jackson illicit content too; sounded good on the release but where is it actually on Alexa. His voice and diction and swagger should just be able to completely replace Alexa. I’d be happy if I never heard her again frankly. Maybe Sam Jackson 2.0 will be improved. I’m so not impressed!

Instead of one word wakeup you have to say 'hey Samuel' each time. His responses are unpredictable - sometimes they are polite, sometimes he is kind of bitchy. You don't know what your going to get.  Voice only works on Echo machines not phones. Potential but still needs development. Fun though when your not in a rush."

Some messages are custom recorded by Samuel so that's great but all others are your typical Alexa outputs but with Samuel's voice modified to read her lines. Would I pay $5 for this feature? No way, probably the introductory .99 price in the beginning is worth it's cost."

I will update this review if they update the experience. I haven’t heard any curse words yet (yes, I set it correctly to explicit). Certain questions should have been easily anticipated and a proper response ready to go. One of the first thing I thought to ask was “Ask Sam what Marsellus Wallace looks like” and I didn’t get the obvious response I expected. Instead Sam read me the Wikipedia entry. Same thing when I asked bout which wallet is his or how he felt about the snakes on the plane. Would also love for him to be the default voice for almost everything, but I realize that might not be possible. On the bright side, it was only $.99 so I really don’t care all that much."

Worth the $.99,"Reviewed in the United States on February 9, 2020",I liked that Sam could answer a variety of things and was funny. I don’t like that I have to use Alexa to ask her to ask Sam something. It was often inaccurate and was limited in what it could do. I was thinking I could simply change the echo’s voice/personality to “Sam’s”. It was near and a deal for $.99 but I’ve long since stopped using it or remembering it’s there as it’s clunky to use. Nice novelty.

The presented marketing description leads one to believe that this is a ""replacement"" for the stock Alexa voice. It is not. You still have to ask Alexa to ask Sam L Jackson for whatever it is you are requesting. For example: ""Alexa, ask Sam to give me today's weather"". Then ""Sam"" will respond.

I know they have to record individual words in a way that the Echo can piece them together cleanly, but everything comes out slow and over-pronounced. I was expecting more attitude. Even in “explicit” mode it’s pretty boring and staid. I wanted more “MF” in my output. I wanted SLJ, not SLJ’s boring cousin Poindexter."

One thing I don’t like is hey Samuel(wake word) doesn’t work as well as saying “Alexa” . Also too much money. It’s fine, but it is pricey and I don’t even use it that much. Also, pro tip, if you do get it and you have muliple echos, be sure to say “Alexa, enable “hey Samuel” for hey Samuel to work on all of your Alexa devices."

One question I would like recognized is ""Hey Samual, how long did it take you to do this?""Of course, the other voice that would be absolutely fantastic would be Ryan Reynolds.Very entertaining.  Haven't found a repeat (other than ""snakes"" which is absolutely the best callout).Would like verbal support for disabling / enabling explicit content.  That part flashed by quickly but isn't obvious where to do that and a verbal response would be an easy addon to the script given to any celebrity voice."

Who wants to talk to Alexa Everytime and say Alexa ask samuel. To use a voice that you purchased. If this is the way Alexa plans to roll out new voices by having to ask the assistant to speak with that voice it's better to just drop development of new voices as a whole. I am very disappointed on how this was impliemented not because it was a bad a idea but because the way it was designed. By having no way to set a voice as default.

The problem is; there are limited responses with this Celebrity voice. Many times I have to revert back to regular Alexa voice, because my questions or requests could not be answered. Also, recorded Samuel is not as uplifting and humorous as it seemed in advertisements. Very Humdrum. I had to disable Samuel."

You made Sam Jackson a joke.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 15, 2019",#1 fan of Sam Jackson. Amazon could have done way better with this. It’s stupid that I have to ask Alexa to ask Sam to say something. Alexa gets confused. I expected Sam to completely take the place of Alexa’s voice. This is the only reason I switched from google home to echo. The fact that I have to go through Alexa to have Sam respond leave you guessing on what will work and what won’t. So you keep talking to it to figure it out. Already I’m over it and it’s not worth it. Amazon failed Sam Jackson!

SLM does not replace Alexa. You have to get Alexa to ask SLM a question. Additionally, SLM is very (toned down) I.e. politically correct. Definitely not the normal personality you see and hear from him."

It's nice to switch it up from Alexa's boring voice and of course after asking the  right question Samuel finally dropped the F-Bomb and made me and my roommates laugh.Honestly though having his voice and name attached to this, everything comment that it says should have some kind of profanity in it and it doesn't which was kind of a let down."

It is somewhat limited, and would be more fun if you could actually have a conversation with him, instead of listening to a clever retort by him.  But it has been worth purchasing."
B089NGHR7K,Samuel L. Jackson–celebrity personality for Alexa,Novelty & Humor,Ash,2.0 out of 5 stars,I love the idea!,"Reviewed in the United States on December 15, 2019",But Alexa understands even fewer questions than usual.  Even if I use recommended questions Sam replied with random facts about whatever he thinks I said.  Ask him his favorite movie and he tells you some person's fav without specifying who he is talking about.  The only plus is that it was super cheap.

You have to use the command, ""Alexa, have Samuel..."" in order to activate this, and even then it doesn't always work. I sort of expected to have Samuel just become the default voice."
B089NGHR7K,Samuel L. Jackson–celebrity personality for Alexa,Novelty & Humor,Jonathan E. Roberts,2.0 out of 5 stars,Requires an Extra Step for Each Command,"Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2019","We love to hear his voice.  In my head, the entire app would change to a Samuel L. Jackson voice.  In reality, each time you want to hear Sam's voice you have to say ""Alexa, ask Samuel to (tell me the weather, tell me a joke, etc.).  The extra step takes most of the fun out of it.  It would have been much funnier if we could change to his voice all the time!"
B089NGHR7K,Samuel L. Jackson–celebrity personality for Alexa,Novelty & Humor,KDL,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazon testing the market, not a real product yet ...","Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2019","Enabling celebrity voice to fully replace Alexa voice is probably a significant investment for Amazon. Before fully investing down that path, I think Amazon is just polling the market to see if there is enough demand for this type of product, which is also evident in the initial $0.99 promotional price. If there's enough people trying it and unhappy with it's current limited ability, it's a sign that it may be worth further investing to fully develop it. If not, it's just $0.99 so hopefully people who bought it aren't super mad about how little the current version does."
B089NGHR7K,Samuel L. Jackson–celebrity personality for Alexa,Novelty & Humor,Max,2.0 out of 5 stars,It's alright,"Reviewed in the United States on February 4, 2021","I bought it because it seemed like a cool alternative to Alexa, but most of the time I have trouble with it recognizing what I want. It also does not have very many cool things at it's disposal. It also says that there is an explicit version to enable but that doesn't change much besides the way he sings happy birthday. Overall, its kind of just meh. I hope they add much more because this has a lot of potential to be something pretty neat."

Jackson–celebrity personality for Alexa,Novelty & Humor,Kendall Tolar,4.0 out of 5 stars,Hey Samuel,"Reviewed in the United States on December 16, 2020",This works just like Alexa. You have to say hey Samuel instead of Alexa/echo. If you say hey Samuel and ask a question you will get your answer in Samuel’s voice. For example I can say Hey Samuel who are the dolphins playing on Sunday? And Sam will tell me who they are playing. It’s a fun feature to add to your echo device!

In fact Alexa usually takes over for a Samuel when he can't answer the question. It's not very practical for everyday use but it is pretty fun when we have people over. I highly recommend the rated R version

He is amazing and needs to be able to completely replace Alexa's voice. To ask Alexa to ask Samuel L. Jackson for anything is just plain asinine. Please change this and allow Sam to work independently of asking Alexa for anything.PS. Our Fire Cube never listens to us anyway. Our Alexa is far less superior then others regular Alexa systems.

Update to say ""hey samuel""","Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2020","So it's a gag thing obviously. It's a voice over it doesnt need to be perfect. It's for fun.

""(Wake word), check for an update"" please note that wake word is usually Alexa unless you changed it."

Jacksons?  Well, you can't really do that.  He cant run any of your skills, apps, or routines.  He will just tell you he can't and tell you to ask Alexa.  How lame!  He can tell you the time, tell you the weather, and if you ask him to tell you a joke, a pre-recorded joke will play, and it won't be funny.  Just make it to where everything Alexa can do, Sam can do.  Its just a voice.  You guys really messed this one up! I hope they change it."

To hear Samuel L Jackson tell me things with some zip. There is no zip.  He says a few bad words (I did choose the explicit version), but there is no attitude behind them. They’re just words being read.  I understand that he can’t put flair in the specifics of the weather, but at least his catchphrases could be said with the same verve as in the movies. So far I’m disappointed.  At least it was only 99 cents."

B08XVTH3ZP,Melissa McCarthy - celebrity personality for Alexa,Novelty & Humor,Lady Incredulous,2.0 out of 5 stars,Very limited and disappointing.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2021","I am such a HUGE Melissa fan that when I heard she was a new voice for Alexa, I ran out and bought a $60 Alexa device despite having a totally Google home setup. I was then shocked to learn that I had to pay an additional $4.99 for the Melissa voice package (Google provides celebrity voice add-ons for FREE, including John Legend and Issa Rae.)I paid up, and it has turned out to be a real disappointment. ""Hey Melissa Tell Me a Story"" gets you some cute antecdotes from her life told by her, but there are only, like, six of them and then they start to repeat. ""Hey Melissa Tell me a joke"" is fun, and there does seem to be a fairly good supply of those so that it doesn't run out too fast.Other than that, there are some cute asides to regular requests. If you ask her to set an alarm, she says ""Normally I don't want to alarm people but I...I get where you're going with that..."" and if you ask for a weather report she has some cute comments like ""Trying to decide to wear, eh?"" and so forth.But by and large there just isn't a lot added onto the feature to justify charging extra for it, and to be honest I'm probably going to return my new Alexa device and call it a $5 investment in a few chuckles for a few days."

The only thing I don't like about it (compared to the other two celebrity voices Samuel L. Jackson and Shaq) is that it feels a little ""light"" on material maybe, or perhaps just too tame and kid-friendly.  I'm an adult, and I prefer not to hear child-approved content.  But that aside, it is a fairly diverse voice with a lot of material and is easily recognized by my Echo Dot when I ask."

B08XVTH3ZP,Melissa McCarthy - celebrity personality for Alexa,Novelty & Humor,Laura M,3.0 out of 5 stars,Don't set your expectations too high,"Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2021","I'm a big fan of Melissa McCarthy so when the offer for her personality on Alexa came up, I was happy to know I'd get to hear her voice and some of her stories. The stories she shares are interesting if you're a fan. If not, I don't think you'd be interested to hear many of them. The reason I'm giving a low rating is because of the integration. I realize she doesn't have time to sit and record a response for every question I ask, that's expecting too much. However, it would be great if there were a way for Alexa to take over. If the Melissa feature can't help, then have it automatically switch over to Alexa so I don't have to ask again. Something like, ""I'm sorry, I can't help with that but Alexa can."" Other than that, it's okay if you're not expecting too much from it."

I agreed with my Alexa and promptly purchased her voice package to add to the mix. I decided to switch to her voice for my alarm the following morning. BIG MISTAKE!!! I’m woken up to the sound of a weird hippy chord being strummed on a guitar and an equally hippy nasally sound of what I assume is singing about looking out the window at a rain storm and she doesn’t want to be there cause she would rather be, and I quote, “anywhere but here”. Well guess what Melissa? Me too. I bought this voice package under the assumption that it’d be comedic. It was literally the antithesis of anything that could be remotely considered funny. It was pure garbage and made me feel like I’d somehow relocated to the inner bowels of Portland or Seattle. And now I can’t get rid of her off my Alexa even when I said disable her voice and put Sam Jackson back, she STILL WAKES ME UP!!! 😫😭😫😭😫😭 Stick with Sam and like Nancy Reagan said, “Just Say No” to Melissa McCarthy’s voice package. Stop trying to be a serious musician.I’ll still see every movie of hers though. She’s not singing in those."

B08XVTH3ZP,Melissa McCarthy - celebrity personality for Alexa,Novelty & Humor,Wills944,4.0 out of 5 stars,Loved it!,"Reviewed in the United States on August 26, 2021","I stumbled across this Melissa skill; normally I wouldn't pay for oddball functions like this but I do like most of her movies. I didn't think I would like having the combo wake words like the 'oogle uses.. but ""Hey Melissa"" does flow pretty good. Instead of using the enable it on all compatible devices, I simply went to each room and threw the ""echo, introduce me to Melissa"" on each device.. All of them began the intro. 'She' does handle the basic turn things on and off and most other vocal functions. 'She' will hand shopping and other lists, ""wheres my stuff"" to the standard voice. I asked it for the weather and was surprised it was her voice and a little quip about it and they even made the effort to use the segmenting tech to put the weather details in her voice also. That left me a little puzzled..if they made the effort to make the digital segments for weather details.. why didn't they continue on to cover lists, and the other stuff handled off to Alexa...  I do hope the voices become a lot more integrated into everything that we have to interact with, I may buy more allowing each person to have their echo individualized.  Overall though, Very happy with it, it was super simple to activate and a lil fun having a real celebs voice."

No complaints here, but if I could suggest somthing to really go above the top which is where you are, to the next level would be to incorporate skills that can ask questions back and wait for a response.  Like a more interactive, conversation kind of thing.  But great job on this app. Hopefully Amazon and all other developers take direction from yall given yalls good reviews."

Coupang was recently IPO'ed on NYSE but strongly recommend you sell the stocks if you bought them. Products on Coupang do not carry any description about the products they sell, just pictures. I purchased an edible product based on the product name of ""bar"" as it implies the product is a dried one like edible bars we can see on market. However, it was not bar but a real food which SHOULD be stored in a freezer. Its shape was just like a bar. Who could tell it just by seeing the picture. Further, I couldn't return it because it is a real food. I feel I MUST appreciate the wonderful service of Amazon. They are supplier-oriented, while Amazon is customer-oriented. I'd like to extend my personal gratitude to all Amazon workers from the bottom of my heart. Thank you, Amazon!"

B071R77N49,Assure me,Novelty & Humor,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than Mom,"Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2019","This skill is so great. After witnessing my mother exit my life and enter the last train cart on a north bound caravan wafting with drum thumping hippies, there’s been an intense void of feminine affection in my life. So much so that I’ve stumbled from one woman’s arms to the next. There was Kaszcha, the Ukranian fire eater who taught me to set my gaze ahead, and Berta, the Spanish diver who taught me to look inward (Rest in Peace, Berta), and among many others. In my attempts to simmer the bubbling couldron that is that void (Mother! Why?) I find that my soul grows weary. In my attempts to grow close to these womens (not too close!), I have pushed myself to my emotional limits. However, this skill changed my life. Upon finding Assure Me, not only do I have someone to recognize the complex details in my forlorned, yet gentle, soul — I have it in an objective, white, late-middle-aged female’s voice. When I’m wondering who’s paying attention to the sheer capacity of fastidious love I have to give, when I’m wondering if there’s anyone who sees me beyond my wild and whimsically Arcadian exterior, when I’m wondering how many times I’ve blinked in a day, I turn to this skill. With it, I’ve found that I no longer need jocular validation from a fulsome gaggle of women. In this skill, I have discovered my own luminous ability to give MYSELF the love that I need. Thank you, Assure Me. You have saved me."

If you need to tell Alexa you just sneezed - that takes out the whole novelty of having her....  Oh just nevermind!!  :-(Also - why nothing for when a cat meows?!  Sure Alexa can say something clever if a dog barks - but nothing for their feline counterparts?  LAME!That said - I actually do LOVE everything else about Alexa.  It's a wonderful tech!  A good example of ""how it ought to be"" with tech.  So good at everything else - it makes it just that much more of a disappointment that she won't say ""Bless You"" when i sneeze!  Frustrating!"

B06VV3F7RM,Good Vibe,Novelty & Humor,Mike in San Diego,4.0 out of 5 stars,I have a lot of fun with this one.,"Reviewed in the United States on February 3, 2018","It lets you get interactive with Alexa.  I do have a few minor (?) suggestions...Add some trigger words that are not as awkward and forgettable as ""(Alexa) ask good vibe...""  Maybe something like ""(Alexa) Please tell me...""  or (Alexa) Please answer this...""Get rid of the censorship (unless Amazon requires it.)  Or make it a switch in the web setup application to censor with the beep or not to censor.  Let's face it, people will like hearing Alexa talk a bit ""naughty.""If possible, add the ability to pause and/or emphasize in the response scripts.Give the ability to respond with a response dependent on what the user says after the defined answer is played.  For example, maybe if the user responds with ""Thank You"" it says ""You're Welcome""  OR if the user says, ""That's not right"" it says ""Sorry., I'll try to do better next time.""Or, nicer still, if the question is something like, ""I am looking for a birthday""  I would respond, ""whose birthday would you like to know? The user might say, ""Joe's"" or ""Mary Smith's"" and it would respond with the correct date."
B06VV3F7RM,Good Vibe,Novelty & Humor,Micah Harkins,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Best Way To Add Custom Content to Your Alexa Echo Device, But Could Use Some Changes","Reviewed in the United States on March 25, 2018","******EDITED 11-1-2018******Previously (below) I stated ""Good Vibe was one of the best Alexa skills thus far"" which was true at the time of my writing that review.  However, this has since changes and with Alexa Blueprints, you can do everything that Good Vibe does but MORE and Blueprints are highly customized for YOUR Echo device or Alexa app - for example, you don't have to ask the Echo to open an app to then open a customized script, with Blueprints you directly access the script by simply asking the Echo what you programmed in your Blueprint.  This is a FREE service offered for Alexa/Echo and can be found at blueprints.amazon.com and is MUCH better than the Good Vibe app is.-----------OLD REVIEW FOLLOWS BELOW THIS LINE -------------This is one of the best Echo Alexa skills thus far!  I love the ability to add your own audio responses from a file or recording, and I hope they expand the interjections (which are automatically inserted clips of Alexa saying phrases), and the web text-to-speech has the potential for so many different uses!  Easy to use, and once you link your account, you can use your computer to go to alexavibe.com to set up your commands and responses.There are two things I would like to ask the developers to integrate or change.  The first is the editing/bleeping of curse words - in my house, there are only two adults, and when we added ""house rules"" for guests to our home, it bleeped out the word bull**** when we put in ""We do not tolerate any bull****.  My wife and I met in the US Navy, and we swear, well, like sailors, we're forty and we don't need our words censored.The second feature I would like the developers to work on is instead of ""Alexa ask Good Vibe to"" to something easier to say.  If the developers can't make it so you can just say ""Ask Alexa To"" then instead of Good Vibe (which sounds like an adult app, to be honest), could you allow it to be invoked by something like ""Alexa ask/tell the announcer to""  or perhaps ""Alexa ask/tell the presenter to"".  My wife constantly confuses ""good vibe"" with ""good vibes"" so the invoke word for it is long, strange-sounding to our guests - they wonder what ""good vibe"" means - and also has no relation to what the app actually does.Also, it wouldn't hurt to be able to  ""collapse"" all of the current commands so there isn't an insane amount of scrolling to do to get to any previous commands - or paginate them somehow.  If you have a lot of custom commands and need to change the parameters there is way too much scrolling on the page you add them.But overall this is one incredible app and way of adding your own custom content to your Echo device!  I highly recommend that everyone who has an Echo device use this app."

It's not serious cat translation. That actually should be pretty clear from the description of the skill, which mentions adding sass, but it looks like some reviewers are confused about the nature of this skill.  I've tried the skill three times, each time I told it the same cat behavior, which was my cat was eating. Each time I got a different answer that gave me a chuckle. Clearly, it's just giving random responses to whatever you describe. But it is worth it for the laugh, and sometimes it really describes my cat well just by accident."

And he doesn't talk, since he's, you know, a cat.For the last three weeks I've left out a can of tuna for Mr. Bojangles, and he wouldn't eat it. Aren't all cats supposed to love tuna?! He lost 6.4 lbs, and I wasn't sure what to do. Nathan won't give me the full ransom money if his cat is in bad health. Three days ago, he finally ate the tuna and then I found chunks of tuna all over my carpet.I couldn't tell what happened, but thanks to this app, I was able to figure out that Mr. Bojangles is allergic to seafood! Now I know that I should feed him something better like raw eggs, since he'll need protein to get his weight back up. Thanks Cat Translator!"

It does not translate your cat's sounds/voice, nor does it ""speak"" to your cat in any way. Alexa says she can ""interpret cat behavior"" and asks YOU what you're cat is doing. Ok, I'll play along, I thought.So I answered that my cat is listening at the door for a cat that was eating on the front porch. Alexa responded that my cat is trying to tell me ""she loves me and wants to spend the rest of her 9 lives with me"". How cute. But this cat is a boy, so I think she's off a bit.I gave it one more try and to my horror, this response was both wacky and a cruel. I told Alexa my cat was chasing a bug on the outside of the window pane. Alexa's response? Here it is, and you can hopefully use it to decide if you want this skill for your unit.""Your cat is seriously ill and needs to go the vet.....Or your cat has gas. I always get those two confused.""REALLY????? REALLY AMAZON???? REALLY ALEXA????"

B0751856JY,Dope Wars,Novelty & Humor,Jacob Belford,5.0 out of 5 stars,THIS GAME IS THE PWN,"Reviewed in the United States on August 25, 2017","This a simple port of the text-based calculator game. To start quick,decline the tutorial, say ""buy weed"" (you can say ""buy broccoli"" insteadif you feel more comfortable with that), then ""go to queens"", once youget there, ""sell everything"". You'll probably turn a decent profit andhave enough of a cushion to explore the rest of the city and get a senseof the prices (""check prices"").If you want the full list of commodity name substitutions, say ""alexa,my kids are home"" and ""check prices"". To switch back, say ""alexa, thecoast is clear"". You can always interrupt the dialog using the wakeword, and then issue a command (""alexa, inventory"").Just in case you never played the original, the game is a simplecommodity trading simulator where you have 30 turns to make as muchmoney as possible. If you're having any trouble getting alexa tounderstand you, I definitely recommend taking a few minutes to do thevoice training on the alexa app. It will improve your experience notjust with dope wars, but with every other alexa skill. It's not such abig deal for ""yes or no"" games, but this has a bunch of differentcommands, so alexa can get confused if she hasn't learned your voiceyet.It was a pleasure helping to write some of the text for this skill, andI hope anyone who played the original enjoys it. it!"

There are better ""knock knock"" jokes out there than the first few I heard with this Skill.  The second problem is that I played seven jokes in a row and, of that, there were are least two repeats.  Later on, I re-tried this Skill and nearly all of the same jokes as I had already heard were told again.  Groan...On the plus side, you can simply say into the Voice Remote ""knock knock""; you don't have to say ""ask Knock Knock to tell me a joke.""  Alexa will respond by saying ""knock knock"".  That's your cue to now say into the Voice Remote ""who's there?""  Alexa might say ""snow"".  You respond into the Voice Remote ""snow who?""  Then, Alexa completes the joke (as bad as it is).In summary, I really like the ease of invoking the Skill and how you can interact with Alexa as you normally would with a knock knock joke.  If you don't interact properly, Alexa will let you know it.However, the selection of jokes needs work both in the quality of the jokes and to prevent repetition after just a few jokes.I hope the developer continues to work on it because I think it's clever, it plays well on Fire TV, and it could be a really great Skill."

B07QQ26512,Big Fart,Novelty & Humor,Robert P. Inverarity,1.0 out of 5 stars,Activated unintentionally in a serious meeting with lots of people,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2020","Amazon’s policy of turning on skills without confirmation really let off a big one in an important meeting. I said something that the Echo in the next room interpreted as “Alexa fart”, and it logged three separate activities for it, enabling this skill and activating it, so it started farting in my general direction while I had the mic in a video call of many people.  While this was somewhat amusing in concept, it was much less so in practice. It rather damages one’s perception among one’s peers to be screaming at a farting robot to stop.Based on the other reviews here, this app seems problematic for a number of reasons. I believe Amazon should consider yanking it."

Matthew called the skill, ""Short Bedtime Story"". After only a few short years of hard work, Matthew convinced Amazon to accept the ""Short Bedtime Story"" skill into their catalog so everybody could play it. The only problem was that so many folks reviewed the skill giving it just one star! Can you imagine? One star! Folks complained that I talk too fast; but there was no way for Matthew to adjust my speaking speed. Another complaint was that the pronouns were wrong for the name even though Matthew programmed 3000 boy's names and 4000 girl's names. Matthew decided to write many different stories for folks to play and hoped they would give his skill a bunch of stars. Well now you know my story.

Great funny stories that involve the child by name and hilarious and encouraging closing statements.However, there currently seems to only be about 10-15 stories available so repeats happen fairly quickly.  Also, a few of them are not ideal for younger kids that deal with zombies or that the toddler is an evil witch.  You can always have Alexa stop and then do again, but really these should be removed.  It's also sometimes tough to get Alexa to launch properly for some reason.Lots of potential though, just needs some tweaks and more stories to be added.  Perhaps the developer is willing to accept submissions (assuming they are carefully manually reviewed before being added), that would allow for a ton of new stories fairly quickly!!!"

To me winning feels like being the best. More so than being better than others, the true rush of excitement and pride comes from besting the past version of yourself which you needed to do in order to rise to the top. In the deepest ecstasy of victory, winning feels like drinking water when you're thirsty. Winning feels like getting getting the pregnancy test back negative. Winning feels like getting some extra fries in the bag when you order drive through. Winning feels like smashing a blue button and hearing some guy yell ""GEEEGEEE!!!!!"" And in 2019, winning feels like saying ""Alexa start GG button""To all the people complaining this doesn't do other sounds you're missing the point. You don't need it to make other sounds. You need to start winning."

B01GOSN706,Meow!,Novelty & Humor,Scott,5.0 out of 5 stars,Where's that cat???,"Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2016","I live in an elder care facility. The day I started using this app I didn't stop to consider its effect on anyone else who might be in the area. After I got into a 15 minute conversation with Alexa, one of the nurses appeared at my open door, listened for a second, then spoke to some others down the hall. ""It's in here. It's an electronic cat.""  Apparently,  they had been searching for the cat that was loose in the facility."
B01GOSN706,Meow!,Novelty & Humor,M. A. Weber,1.0 out of 5 stars,This MAY cause huge cat behavior problems!,"Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2019","We played this “fun” skill for about 4 seconds. It sounded like a very distressed cat (not cute cat sounds) and it caused our sweet brother cats to attack each other viciously. They are litter-mates who have lived well together for 10 years with no history of aggression. Now they are having to be reintroduced like they were strangers over several weeks. We are praying they get past this - playing it is now one of the biggest regrets of my life. This has caused a tremendous amount of distress in our home. NEVER play this if you have cats unless you want to potentially destroy their relationship. I wish I had been warned before trying it out. A notice on the Echo that it might cause behavioral problems in some cats before it started would have prevented all of this, as we would never have risked it. I hope you don’t chance it.UPDATE: It took exactly two years and a few thousand dollars spent on vet bills, anxiety medicines, and pheromones, plus countless hours of stressful work to reunite them. The sound triggered a redirected aggression incident. The cat who was initially attacked is still a bit wary of his brother (it's definitely not like their happy prior relationship, but at least they are finally coexisting in the same space again). The aggressive sounds need to be removed from this app. Please don't take a chance on using it if you actually have cats. It's not worth the risk, and I would hate for anyone to have to go through what we did because of this..."

However, it would be nice if the Meow Meow feature could run for a time period, such as 10 minutes incrementally.  My cat likes to stalk the cat meow. It keeps my cat curious,and playful, but it needs to run for a longer time.  No feed back from a person or animal should be needed.  The different cat meows ae interesting to my cat.  If I leave the house for the day, it also would be nice to be able to use my Amazon Fire to ask Alexa to play Meow Meow at home for 10 minutes every few hours for that my cat could be entertained."

B01GOSN706,Meow!,Novelty & Humor,clintkeep,4.0 out of 5 stars,Smells like HUMANS to me,"Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2021","Attention parents of felines, If your cat is socialized (or unsocialized) and doesn't have any emotional baggage (mine do) or if your cat is NOT FERAL, there's no way you can really blame this app for your cats unpredictable behavior. There's nothing wrong with your cat(s) or this app. Not entirely the app, other than most of the meow sounds being made by humans LAME! (like 60% of them.) Its kind of embarrassing. Please stop! The legitimate MEOW works really well as a sound distraction when my cats get that 3am need to stampede the hallway but i only use the app after the cats have been up and down 20 times. Or knocked something over. Or when one plays too rough and makes his sibling screech so loud that my neighbors will peek out their window. Sometimes I just can't shake their attention with my voice and I don't make convincing cat sounds but the few that are realistic sounding or actual samples taken from a feline that Alexa dispenses from her box, those get my cats attention every time as long as she keeps making the sound. Or until Alexa plays that one or two samples that clearly sound like a human. That's where i get disappointed. If the cats respond (loud enough)  it can go back and fourth for a minute or two but I can't expect much at this point since Alexa needs data. Clearly she doesn't have much on cats. But doesn't mind making you spend money on upgrades. It might be worth it I could be sure there's no humans attempting to mimic cat linguistics."

They perk up when I ask Alexa to open meow meow. Over time, they've become desensitized from the app because I've opened it so much. Also, mostly ot plays humans making cat sounds which isn't too appealing (my opinion) to cats. Alexa does play one actual cat noise and that is what my cats pay attention to. Other people who have reviewed this app incorrectly call this sound an aggressive cat call. If this is the same sound I'm hearing, it definitely is not aggressive but a call for ""attention"" rather. I do feel badly for the people whose cats became upset after they launched this app however, keep in mind, all cats have different personalities just like people and you really do not know how they will react when they hear another ""cat"" in their domain. Overall, it's o.k. needs more real cat meows, and to stay on more than a few seconds."

He's a spoiled baby (thanks to me) and when his brother cat passed away recently, Keats became an only child and could not be happier about his newfound monopoly on my attention. So without thinking, I tried this app on him and I could see the tension in his face: the last thing he wants around here is another cat.So I'd just recommend thinking about your cat a little before exposing her or him to this skill, as it's very convincing and will make your kitty think there's another of the feline kind around. Will you cat like that or will it make her/him uncomfortable?"

WTH?My 6th request was approved ... Yay… Nope not yay because it played the wrong comedian. I don’t know how it mistook Tracy Morgan for Vic Henley!Irritated I then asked for Gilda Radner which I was pleasantly surprised to have launch ... but it WASN’t her... I have no idea who it was as it didn’t ever tell me who it was but it certainly wasn’t Gilda!why claim to “offer my favorites“ when you don’t even include so many of the basics? The skill looks promising but instead gave me one disappointment after another… And it doesn’t hear very well because I had to ask for Chris Rock and repeat the name 8X without it understanding what I said… If you don’t have Chris Rock you need to shut the skill down because it’s not ready to be published yet.

My one cat does run to the echo, although every time I go to the kitchen my cats follow me in so I really do not need it to get them to run to the kitchen. I probably will not use this a whole lot because it is kind of mean to tease a cat that he is going to get food and then he does not. But it could be useful to use in a routine when I am not at home if I want him to come to the camera. I tried the shake a treat bag and that was pretty terrible, it sounds like the bag is being crumpled and rubbed against the microphone, good if you want your cat to run away and hide! Change it to a shake of a bag of treats and forget opening the bag and that would be perfect. But the can of cat food opening is pretty spot on so I am basing my five star review on that.

Twice I have accidentally said either Really? or That’s funny! after she has told me something unbelievable - almost reflexively - and she has responses!So this is fun for someone who only talks to the dog or the cat most of the time.Now i just gotta get the launch phrase to work consistently.

B071VRJ8RY,Uh-huh feature,Novelty & Humor,Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Hard to open, and barely works when it does.","Reviewed in the United States on May 6, 2019","You have to really pronounce ""uh huh"" for Alexa to recognize it, but once you get the hang of pronouncing it right it's not too hard to open. When the skill does open, she says ""default"" most of the time, with an occasional ""uh huh"". However, the first time I opened the skill Alexa said ""Help"", ""Default"", and something that sounded like ""close"" before closing out of the feature. Pretty spooky."

Now, that was Alexa, speaking into my microphone, translated by talk to text, just to illustrate my point.....IMO, the ""skill"" is rendered virtually useless, without both, or at the minimum, one of these phrases to trigger the it. If one has to say ""Open these Nuts"" to start the Punchline, its reminiscent of the drunk guy in the bar, who ruins your joke, by revealing the punchline too soon.....

Now repeat.","Reviewed in the United States on May 30, 2019","NUMEROUS ISSUES:-The name “speak repeat“ implies that it helps you to sound like someone with their tone, inflection, accents etc. but it does none of that.-The summary stating you have famous quotes etc. including actors, poems, speeches, etc. implies that it offers character dialogue with specific styles but the app doesn’t even recognize style nor offer it for example it would be helpful if famous lines from movies were included like Scarlet O’Hara from gone with the wind with some of her legendary lines… In a southern accent.-I don’t get the value of any of this at all unless you’re a foreigner attempting to learn English. All it does is play clips, 3-4 syllables at a time.It’s incredibly tedious in the few times that it does allow me to repeat what it has said it doesn’t give enough time to repeat verbatim.-Also in your summary you say that you can sing ALONG With a song but you can’t. You can only repeat every couple of words and that too is tedious AF!-The entire catalog is so incomplete and limited why don’t you just call it what it is, “A SAMPLE OF PATRIARCHY”... you have not A SINGLE WOMAN offered in your quotes, speeches, movie characters, poets, songs! WTF?!  Is it not enough that women have been left out of the history books, children’s textbooks and leadership roles throughout the world but you just perpetuate it! I can see why after going to your webpage and seeing the make up of your “team“: Anil + 3 ppl, all male, all Asian, all millennials, all looking incredibly awkward.Broaden your horizons and then your catalog will follow.<<<<<<THIS ‘SKILL’ IS NOT EVEN READY FOR RELEASE AS A SKILL. It’s just a demo & it’s worthless! >>>>>>>Either take it off of elections skill options or make it usable and at least I have your summary accurately state what it does or is because if this is the result of an INSPIRED ANIL... Well let’s just say I’d hate to see him on a bad day."

This fortune cookie has grand ambitions. It weaves together a whole bunch of topics that it can provide quotes from. Unfortunately the audio interface is rather clumsy and not well thought through. This leads to irritating sequences like:Alexa: ""Please say 'yes' or 'no'.Me: YesAlexa: ""Yes is not a valid input at this point"".Usefulness: 2 out of 5. Although the breadth of quotes is impressive, number wise, it suffers in execution. It is hard to be inspiring in the halting unnatural speech that you get when Alexa reads untailored prose. Quotes are like poetry. To fully get their meaning across, they need pauses at the right points. No editing has been done of these. Someone just took them off the internet, and has Alexa spit them out. In this case quantity does not make up for quality.Novelty: 3 out of 5. I'm really tired of ""inspiration quote"" skill. Really tired of them. But I have to give kudos to Mike Waldrop for having a topic based one. I've often thought if I ever do a fortune cookie skill that I'd do a multi-plexed mash-up skill. And this is probably would it would look like. Well, maybe with a smoother interface.Overall: 3 out of 5. This has grand ambitions, and could have been really good.

It's just a fortune cookie, no real design here. The quote doesn't even come up on the card. This would have been helpful for the ones that went by too quickly.Usefulness: 3 out of 5.

I've often wished I could have the entire collection of his radio shows, but for many reasons that never happened.This is one of the best collections I've encountered not only of Benny, but Phil Harris/Alice Faye, Dennis Day, Mr. Kitzel and many others.  It has been a joy to drop in from time to time (or in my case a long time at a time) and enjoy great shows.The overall quality is quite good.  There are a few issues with sound quality, but thankfully that is the rare occasion.If you enjoy good comedy, this is a definite plus for your list."

The free version of the application only gives you 4 stories. That is it - just 4 - period!Just a touch stingy in my humble opinion. The 4 stories provided were entertaining. For a free app that wished me to purchase an upgrade, I would have thought they would have enough stories for a month so I was hooked enough to want to pay. After 4 nights, no way, no how will I pay any money to obtain a version which then might ask me to pay more. I feel deceived."

It will have you pick a favorite subject or ask if you want to spin the wheel. No matter what you choose, it always responds, so you know it understood. Then it's as if it seems to think it's telling the story, but there is dead silence. We have 3 echo dots, one in each kids room. We pay the premium to have access from multiple devices. But even if only one kid is opening story time, it almost never works. It's very frustrating and I wish Amazon would fix this."

This app crashed 2 times since I’m writing a bad review so I had to copy paste and send so these crooks would let it fly. The worse thing I ever did was buy this Alexa trash. Siri is a million times better and less stressful not perfect but way better then Alexa who seems she got dropped on her head way to many times. I wish I could do it all over again and never even get this super faulty item with the worse skills. The fact their called skills and the fact you have to activate trash skills to even connect is ridiculous when the others do ut seemlessly. Honestly if I didnt spend over 1k I would toss it all out do to the aggrevation and Alexa being so dimwitted and never answering questions correctly. Honestly instead of making life easier it causes more stress and you have to repeat yourself multile times even when you’re in the same room. Not defected just trash because I have the Show and Dot along with the premium hub and its all trash and a waste after trying to make a smarthome well you get what you pay for since I wanted to cheap out this is what I get. Should’ve stuck with Apple.

Alexa does not speak in this Skill.  I distinguished 4 different applause tracks (there might be more, but I could only clearly distinguish 4).  One was enthusiastic clapping as if from an auditorium full of people.  One was a small group of people (maybe 7-8) clapping and included a few voices saying ""yay"".  The third sounded like 5-6 people clapping.  The fourth sounded like 3-4 people clapping without much enthusiasm.  The tracks play randomly; you can't select.The really positive thing about this app is that it can be invoked by just saying into the Voice Remote ""my applause"".  If you don't properly enunciate ""my applause"", Fire TV might direct you to select from ""my Flaws"", ""my Outlaws"", or ""my Claus"".In summary, I like the ease and words used to invoke the app.  I think the applause tracks could be more robust, because if you're gonna manufacture your own applause you might as well go big."

B01N4Q2GU1,"The ""I'm Poor"" Skill",Novelty & Humor,SamIAm,1.0 out of 5 stars,Skill Developer Didn't Check for Bugs or Out of Date,"Reviewed in the United States on February 7, 2019","This skill had potential to be really funny and useful, but it doesn't work the way it's advertised. I really wanted to give it 2 stars because it's only meant to be a simple skill to make friends and family laugh, but the syntax is all wrong. You have to ask, ""Alexa, open poor"", which isn't really as funny as, ""Alexa, who is poor"". And when you say the latter, Alexa instead of opening the skill, tells you about Henry Varnum Poor, the architect, which is annoying. Also, the developer listed ""who is"" as a prompt, which also does not work. Perhaps this skill was functioning when it was first made, but became obsolete, as Alexa became smarter and for example, started looking up things like ""Henry Poor"" to reply to casual questions. Seems that the Alexa AI itself is sometimes at odds with open/free Skill development, because as she gets smarter and replies to all sorts of stuff, a developer has to make their skill more lame by making the prompt something that won't confuse the AI, like ""Alexa use ""__clunky name of skill here__"" to tell me ""__the thing you want to know__"" which doesn't sound as fun in social settings and is harder to remember when using Skills off the cuff as well. Womp Womp. Bottom line: fix the syntax, so that it works as described in advertisement (or update the Skill advertised info)."

A couple months ago the voice changed to a soft whisper which sounds like the narrator is trying to sound cute but it doesn't work. His voice is too low, much lower than all the other voices including the Word of the Day (also by Volley). It's so frustrating that after listening for over 2 years I've taken it off the Flash briefing and out of our Alexa skills."
