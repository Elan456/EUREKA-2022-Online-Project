B01F8BSE8U,Multiples,Education & Reference,Police Academy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great multiplication quiz app,"Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2017",The app has multiple levels. It is a great way to review and challenge yourself with a little math to keep you sharp.
B019S6O3LS,The Bible,Education & Reference,THATZLIFE,2.0 out of 5 stars,i used to love it,"Reviewed in the United States on February 22, 2019","i used to love this app. it would have 8 old man reading whatever Bible verse or chapter you asked with some calm music in the background. however, this morning suddenly Alexa began to read and it just wasnt nice to hear. I dont want to hear the Bible read in a robotically manner. I dont know if there is an option to change it back to the man or what.  I hope there is!"
B019S6O3LS,The Bible,Education & Reference,Deb,1.0 out of 5 stars,Please put back the way it was,"Reviewed in the United States on June 6, 2019",Very disappointed in the change in this app. It used to read in calm male voice now does not understand instruction does not read full chapters does not understand psalms many glitches
B019S6O3LS,The Bible,Education & Reference,H. Smith,1.0 out of 5 stars,..very,"Reviewed in the United States on February 18, 2019","App appears to be broken. It reads the first 3 chapters of any book you ask, then it repeats the third chapter over and over. Never moving past 3rd chapter. Very frustrating. It worked fine up until about a week or so ago. I‚Äôve sent feedback and have seen other comments about it doing this same thing by other reviewers. Please fix it."
B019S6O3LS,The Bible,Education & Reference,Jay,2.0 out of 5 stars,Needs improvement,"Reviewed in the United States on January 9, 2019","This is a good app (skill?) for the Amazon Echo. I use the King James version, and this app reproduces that version accurately. However, it needs some improvement. It can read a single bible verse or multiple verses within a chapter, as well as quote inspirational verses, but it cannot quote multiple chapters in a book. I'm doing a daily bible study with reading the entire bible within a year, and tried as I might, it couldn't read more than one chapter at a time within a particular book,. Also, it seems that Alexa breaks up long sentences in phrases with a slight pause. For example, Alexa reads Genesis Chapter 1 Verse 11 reads as follows:""And God said,"" (pause) ""Let the earth bring forth grass, (pause) ""the herb yielding seed,"" (pause) ""and the fruit tree yielding fruit, (pause) ""after his kind, (pause) ""whose seed is in itself,"" (puase) ""upon the earth,"" (pause) and it was so.""I suppose this is due to a limitation in its speech software. Still, it's not very useful for bible study in my humble opinion."
B019S6O3LS,The Bible,Education & Reference,Oceans24,5.0 out of 5 stars,"version options, different voice please","Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2020","First, reviewing isn't complaining. I love this skill. if you know exactly word for word what you want read you can ask for it. That's as far as this goes. I would prefer a different Bible version. I don't care for this one. I don't care for hearing Alexa reading it. However, I am still grateful for it, thank you. I make suggestions hoping for improvements I'd like to see. If they don't happen I'll still use the skill unless someone else makes what I prefer better. :)"
B019S6O3LS,The Bible,Education & Reference,Mike Powers,1.0 out of 5 stars,I now use it less,"Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2019","I used to use this every day, however, now with the latest changes, I barely use it. Was my favorite app. It lost the flexibility of making reading plans and I do not like hearing Alexa read the Bible. Very disappointing. When an app causes people not to use it, or to move on to another app, it's never a good change."
B019S6O3LS,The Bible,Education & Reference,L. Seeber,2.0 out of 5 stars,Used to love this skill,"Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2020","I used to really like this skill and use it frequently.. now.. ugh. Alexa reading is a no go and when I tell it to read a particular book it will only start at 1st chapter, Alexa really doesn't seem to function too well anymore with this skill. It rarely understands what I'm telling it to do anymore (and yes, I speak distinctly) and I start getting angry at a stupid Ai program (yes, that makes me the stupid one).  I decided to leave this review before disabling this skill and finding a new one.  Mostly I'll just bluetooth my phone thru Alexa anymore and a guy named tmantz has the entire bible on there and I just choose from there."
B019S6O3LS,The Bible,Education & Reference,Kathy,3.0 out of 5 stars,Misses verses,"Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2017","Jeremiah 50 &amp; 51 Alexa only read a portion of the chapter.  When I asked her to read chapter 51 which has 64 verses, she only read to verse 45."
B019S6O3LS,The Bible,Education & Reference,Harrison,1.0 out of 5 stars,terrible update,"Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2019",This update drastically reduced the quality of this skill. The Alexa voice is not as clear as the previous reader and the version being read is NKJV. it would be better if translations could be chosen and the reader was an actual human.
B019S6O3LS,The Bible,Education & Reference,Joseph Kinlin,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't like change,"Reviewed in the United States on June 11, 2019","Used to have male human reader, now it's Alexa. Also only does NKJV."
B019S6O3LS,The Bible,Education & Reference,Brian,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works good,"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2019",Would like to be able to change the version. and the voice.
B019S6O3LS,The Bible,Education & Reference,S. Foster,5.0 out of 5 stars,"God is establishing His Word, be patient and pray","Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2019","I love this app, I hope that people will stop complaining and pray for the continual development of bible apps such as this. Please remember we live in a fallen world. Stay blessed everyone ‚ô•Ô∏èüôÇ"
B019S6O3LS,The Bible,Education & Reference,Me,5.0 out of 5 stars,Chasing God...,"Reviewed in the United States on February 22, 2017","I know that many call for the ability to slow Alexa's voice and I do not disagree. But I have grown quite fond of her quick, monotone presentation. It seems The Spirit challenges me to listen more closely and fight to drill down on the many different lessons/truths presented within each chapter. God blesses me beyond measure through this service. Remember...others who supply this service are your brethren. We're on the same team. I came here today because the other service changed to a slower voice. Some will acclimate. I found it to be uncomfortable. I love you coders. The hands of God are upon you. Hebrews 11:6... diligently seek Him"
B019S6O3LS,The Bible,Education & Reference,catia,4.0 out of 5 stars,Love the KJV,"Reviewed in the United States on April 11, 2017",I would love this app but I couldn't get it to say any of the book of Psalms

B019S6O3LS,The Bible,Education & Reference,Lisa M. Stapp,2.0 out of 5 stars,I'm so Disappointed,"Reviewed in the United States on November 23, 2020","I really wanted to like this, but every time I use it THE BIBLE will not let me use my Alexa to listen to my music or my radio stations. I have to completely reset my ECHO device every time I use this."
B019S6O3LS,The Bible,Education & Reference,Jo M,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good job with most names,"Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2021","I asked for Nehemiah 10 to be read and was very impressed with the quality of the name pronunciations for the most part. While I read a hard copy Bible or listen to blueletterbible.org most days, this could be really useful when wanting to listen as I fall asleep. Very pleased.Ôøº"
B019S6O3LS,The Bible,Education & Reference,David,1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible,"Reviewed in the United States on March 6, 2021","I thought this would be great for when my hands are full and I can't open the Bible, or when my child is doing her Bible study. But this app is so finicky that you have to say exactly the right thing to get it to read a specific verse. Then it wants to give you the long introduction every time! To top it off, I'm not even sure what version it is reading, and you can't change it. I really wanted to like this app but don't"
B019S6O3LS,The Bible,Education & Reference,Eric P,1.0 out of 5 stars,bring back Max McLean,"Reviewed in the United States on February 24, 2019",I don't enjoy Alexa reading the word. What happened to the way it was?
B019S6O3LS,The Bible,Education & Reference,River,1.0 out of 5 stars,Useless,"Reviewed in the United States on June 12, 2020","Will only read a single verse at a time. Why? If you have the whole Bible on there, just let us listen to a chapter at a time!If this is a feature, it should be obvious. I played around with it for quite a while trying to make it work"
B019S6O3LS,The Bible,Education & Reference,John Marsh,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good start, the voice could be better","Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2016","Pretty good but it reads a little too fast and sometimes sounds choppy. Worth having though. To get psalms, I need to actually pronounce the &quot;p&quot; sound to get it to work. You can specify a book and chapter, or narrow it too a verse range, or just aim for an inspirational passage."
B019S6O3LS,The Bible,Education & Reference,Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The Good, the bad and the what?","Reviewed in the United States on August 25, 2018","Good: Finally an app that uses the correct KJV and not counterfeit versions. Like the ability to ask for specific verse, chapter or inspiration. Bad: Alexa speaks the verses faster than normal speech and one cannot comprehend, or use the app for real understanding."
B019S6O3LS,The Bible,Education & Reference,cathusa,3.0 out of 5 stars,Has potent,"Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2017","This is a great app to have, however at the rate Alexa rambles it off, all meaning is lost. It would be nice if one could set the 'speed' of the text being delivered."

B019S6O3LS,The Bible,Education & Reference,Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,What Happened?,"Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2019","After several months of having a daily reading plan it stopped being able to create or read one. Come on now....that was how I started my day, working my way through the entire Bible, or at least I was."
B019S6O3LS,The Bible,Education & Reference,Bradfordko,5.0 out of 5 stars,Finally Alexa does share some wisdom and knowledge,"Reviewed in the United States on January 1, 2019",I discovered this by chance and have been impressed by the reading and inspirational verse when I ask for one.  The inspirational verses vary so I was surprised to hear many familiar ones.  If you have a daily Bible reading plan this makes it possible to listen to the Bible being read and meditate on the message.  So far I have enjoyed it and even if I find a few flaws it is impressive to hear this coming from Alexa device.
B019S6O3LS,The Bible,Education & Reference,Kathy K,1.0 out of 5 stars,where is bible app that read in chronilogical order with a calm mans voice?  please bring back,"Reviewed in the United States on February 23, 2019",please bring back older version

B019S6O3LS,The Bible,Education & Reference,Caitlin Engelke,1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible app,"Reviewed in the United States on December 10, 2020",The Lord isn‚Äôt trying to make a profit. I needed the Lord‚Äôs word and couldn‚Äôt get it due to the cost of the reading of the Bible for 14.95. I have multiple versions of the Bible and do not need someone to read. This is moser for a spiritual consensus. They are definitely trying to rip people off. Also. The readings are very old school. Read from the uversion app
B019S6O3LS,The Bible,Education & Reference,Louise,2.0 out of 5 stars,What is happening?,"Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2018",I like listening to the scriptures but Alexa does read too fats.

B019S6O3LS,The Bible,Education & Reference,Loretta P.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good tool for comparison,"Reviewed in the United States on January 11, 2017",I like having the KJV on this app.  I read my devotional verses from The Way and then have Alexa read them from the KJV.  It is fine to compare.
B019S6O3LS,The Bible,Education & Reference,B. J. LeJeune,3.0 out of 5 stars,Version control issues,"Reviewed in the United States on May 17, 2018",We like having Alexa read psalms in her voice but sometimes she does it and sometimes she doesn‚Äôt. She is inconsistent about what she understands. I tried purchasing a Bible through Audible and I have youversion on my phone but she keeps going back to the KJV by Alexander Scourby when I want a lighter more modern narrator and version. Very frustrating.
B019S6O3LS,The Bible,Education & Reference,B. Edwards,2.0 out of 5 stars,Difficult for App to Comprehend,"Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2021",Sometimes it takes asking for a certain book multiple times. I typically go another route.
B019S6O3LS,The Bible,Education & Reference,Gloria Leustek,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not user friendly,"Reviewed in the United States on March 4, 2021","It's an okay app but...#1 every time I want to hear another reading I have to keep saying Alexa, open the bible and listen to the introduction every time. #2, there is only one version, I prefer NRSV #3, I can't request more than one chapter at a time. #4 I can't pause and resume, #5, Alexa ends in random places and doesn't finish the verse."

B019S6O3LS,The Bible,Education & Reference,James Alexander,3.0 out of 5 stars,Too fast,"Reviewed in the United States on August 10, 2018",Please slow down the rate of of the recitation by twenty five percent. One cannot study and absorb the lessons at such speed. Or make it possible to slow down or speed up so the listener can  comfortably absorb the readings.This should be try for all speaking responses. Half the time is like listening to a legal disclaimer for a bad drug commercial. Give us the power to adapt the speed to our preference.

B07M8R6ZWD,Smart Tree,Education & Reference,NR$JAKI,1.0 out of 5 stars,Read For Connectivity Help Or You‚Äôre Gonna Hate Yourself and the Tree,"Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2020","First of all, Alexa doesn‚Äôt discover this as an actual device so don‚Äôt even bother to try that step.1. Download the Polygroup app. Do nothing with it yet.2. Go to Alexa and download the Polygroup Skill‚Äù. Link it to your Amazon account. Do nothing after.3. Plug in tree, make sure it‚Äôs off(lights not on).4. Open your WiFi settings. Look for the tree. It‚Äôll be ST-******. Connect to it. The password is located on the trees power cable. Be careful if you remove it and write it down because now ours is lost.5. Open the Polygroup App. It should ask you to connect to your home WiFi. Here‚Äôs where I figured out that it does NOT connect or find your wifi if you‚Äôre using 5G. Connect to your 2g network. It will also not tell you if you‚Äôre having connectivity issues. For some reason, every now and then my 2G connectivity gets wonky and won‚Äôt allow any devices to connect. Make sure this isn‚Äôt the case because again, it will not tell you that it cannot connect or if you‚Äôve messed up on the wifi password. It will just say ‚Äúconnection successful‚Äù.6. Make sure go back into your wifi settings and reconnect to your wifi(again, make sure it‚Äôs 2g) because it will not automatically disconnect from the tree‚Äôs WiFi module and it will kick back a message saying ‚Äúregistration failed‚Äù if you don‚Äôt.7. Hit the registration button and enter email.8. Go into Alexa app and go into ‚ÄúSkills‚Äù settings. 9. Find the Polygroup skill, select it and hit launch. Alexa will ask which Echo you want to use to command the tree and will then give you a run down on your tree‚Äôs lighting options.9. Learn the lesson that you should read reviews BEFORE you bought this piece of crap.Here‚Äôs where you need to pay attention:Alexa can‚Äôt officially recognize the device so don‚Äôt even bother having her search for it. You‚Äôll have to tell her to ‚Äúlaunch the smart tree‚Äù and THEN say the commands for the tree once she prompts you to EVERY time to get it to work consistently.It‚Äôs really not a ‚Äúsmart‚Äù tree because you can‚Äôt put it on a timer or configure it to work automatically like all other Alexa ready devices. It‚Äôs really just an extension of the trees physical light switch where it‚Äôs just easier to press it than deal with trying to get it to work with Alexa.I plan on just connecting the tree to a smart plug so it can be on a timer and just keeping it on one light setting anyway. The Alexa/Google capabilities are a joke.I hope this helps someone and saves you time. It took me two days just to get it to work and I‚Äôm pretty tech savvy. You might want to look at different ‚Äúsmart‚Äù trees than this one."
B07M8R6ZWD,Smart Tree,Education & Reference,Cristina Alvarado,4.0 out of 5 stars,"It will work, you just have to troubleshoot it.","Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2020","At first go Alexa would recognize the ‚Äúsmart tree‚Äù and ‚Äúperform‚Äù the command but it wouldnt actually do anything.  I ended up nuking everything and trying again.Unplug the tree, delete personal data from Polygroup app, remove skill from alexa, etc. then set it up all over again (plug in, set up wifi, register, add skill, etc.) but this time after everything was set up, I manually set the lights to ‚ÄúWhite‚Äù and then asked Alexa ‚Äútell smart tree white‚Äù (lights stayed white, expected).  I then asked Alexa ‚Äútell smart tree off‚Äù and it turned off, then ‚Äútell smart tree on‚Äù and it went on. It‚Äôs been working flawlessly ever since.  Also worth noting you need to use ‚Äútell‚Äù not ‚Äúturn‚Äù verbiage as it obviously wont recognize it as a device.Rating 4 stars because I know how much of a pain in the a** software is to perfect and now that its working, its great."

No more tripping over presents to turn the tree lights on and off. 2. When we wake up and go to bed the tree is no longer part of my busy routine. The lights are already on when I get up and it is a welcome part of my day.Many of the reviews indicate they could not get the app to work. Although I did download the app, I do not control the tree through the app. I have set up a routine through my Alexa app to turn the tree on and a second routine to turn the tree off. I have this command set from a completely different room and device in our home and it works perfectly.

You spend just over an hour walking through painfully incoherent setup steps that feel like uncle frank discussing politics after a few too many cocktails. Hang in the you'll get it figured out and you're tree will be the focal point of memories for generations to come. Finally, you get it figured out and you're a little disappointed with its lack luster abilities. The fade and blink settings are practically the same thing. So you have ""9 settings"". White, multicolor and 7 settings of stupid. After getting it figured out just before Valentines day your 3 old son will come along and unplug the cord from the outlet, so you can start this horrendous journey all over again.

B07C76DWPV,Science Wizard,Education & Reference,Voice Spark!,2.0 out of 5 stars,Science Wizard tries to do a lot and gets some of it right but needs retooled.,"Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2018","Besides using the skill for the first time the introduction is pretty long and should be shorten up a bit after the first couple uses. People will stop using your skill if the intro is too long and keeps repeating itself. Use session states in order to switch up the intro or you could pull different intros from an array instead of the same one, variety is key. Keep it fresh. This skill cover four major areas which are science quizzes, debate prompts, thought experiments and scientific formula. You can also learn about Physics, Chemistry and Biology. The skill did have some issues understanding my commands and I found that if you say experiment it will work, but if you say experiments the skill says that it does not understand and closes. I was finally able to get the experiments to work after 30 minutes. The debate function is pretty cool and works fine, but the quiz function will end the skill if you get a question wrong, yes just one question. The developer does provide a detailed explanation which also has links to YouTube videos. I would suggest maybe uploading those to S3 and have them play as their help function.  This skill does use skill cards for the scientific formulas, which is pretty cool.  As I said before this skill could be okay if it was retooled, but in its current state I would not enable it and only give it a half of thumb up."

This is a cat fact finder for cat lovers, so get over it or move on. This  cat fact is very informative. Out of the 10 facts I requested, I did not know 8 of them. I consider myself quite cat oriented with a daughter in law who is a veterinarian and loves to talk shop. The cat facts are quite unique and would be a perfect category for the family. Children love to learn and introducing them to this feature will be a good thing for them, indeed. The entire family can listen, and then discuss the fact.This is a simple category that anyone can use. If your child understands the Alexa Amazon Echo, this can be a great learning tool. It will also teach them to be precise, because Alexa will only answer specific categories.Recommended. prisrob 01-08-16"

B017OBJI46,Cat Facts,Education & Reference,jjaquinta,4.0 out of 5 stars,Fun and rather random,"Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2015","One of the weirdest things I ever came across was a web site devoted to Cat Facts... on Darknet. Here is this clandestine, cloak and dagger platform, frequented by hacktivists,  handlers of illicit goods, (and the odd Ethical Hacker such as myself) and bang! A website about cats. It just goes to show that cats really do get everyone on the Internet. So why not on The Echo?Ease of Use: 5 out of 5. You ask it for a fact about cats, it tells you one. It doesn't get simpler than that. There isn't much to it, but there doesn't need to be. (Asking it to say ""Meow"" is a nice touch, though.)Usefulness: 4 out of 5. If you have no interest in cats, then just forget it. Me, I love cats. And, yeah, I know the API used to back this is public, but it did end up telling me things I didn't know despite my infatuation for the furry beasts. (One of which is clawing me for attention as I write this!) So I have to give a thumbs up for that.Novelty: 3 out of 5. I should have expected this, but I didn't. It is a format that would let you turn any listicle into an app. It might have been more interesting to see it grown into a general front end for listicles. Cute icon, though.Overall: 4 out of 5. Cat Facts is fun and rather random. I'm going to keep it enabled to lighten up my day during boring moments."

Currently I am using still using Prepfit during my Job/Interview practice search.  The app has provided some helpful tips that has made me feel less alone during this process. It somehow manages to provide some insight into how the mind of an interviewer works.  One way it does this is by presenting the same interview question in similar ways. This helps to hone one's approach. Another thing I found helpful was how easy to use the app is inspite it's constrictions to Alexa's voice interface.  In future updates I would like to see an expansion of question categories and possibly a feature where one could record themselves to revist/score answers.

I find her difficult to understand too. It's not helpful for the voice/Alexa to read the abbreviations such as n. for noun. At least I think that's what I'm hearing. Asking Alexa to repeat has not helped. Probably not a great reason to get my dad an Echo Dot, but this is the one of the main reasons I s sprang for one since his hobby is exploring word origins and he can't get around on a computer without help, nor can he see very well anymore.

B072HLP8WH,Slumdog Medicare,Education & Reference,Shay,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good. IMHO could use some tweaks,"Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2018","I have been auditing Medicare in different roles for 22 years, so of course I pay careful attention to the wording of the questions and answers. I think some of the questions could use more specificity. For example, there is a question about which part of Medicare pays for outpatient care. Both Part B and Part C are in the list of answers. Since B was on the list, I know the answer you want is Part B, but since Part B is included in Part C, part C also pays for outpatient. If I was a bene, I might think , 'oh no, I cant enroll in Part C, they dont pay for outpatient'.Also, there is a question about what is the definition of a SEP, the answer in the list is something about continuing to work for an EGHP. This is an example not a definition.I really like this, I play it every day. I dont think anyone has enough brain cells to remember all of the Medicare rules and definitions, but in my opinion, every once in awhile, not often, the wording of the questions could be better. Great job."

Henry,3.0 out of 5 stars,Online archive needed,"Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2019","This program has many strengths, but they sorely need some sort of online system that keeps up with words and definitions. It is very unlikely that hearing a new word once will register it permanently, but I think many WOTD fans would appreciate having an online list to which they can refer back. I've made this request a couple of times back in the early days, when WOTD was under different ownership, and shortly afterwards. No response, though. As it is, it is mildly entertaining and may reinforce words we already know, but can't teach anything unless we are sitting with pen in hand writing down what it says. Five stars will be awarded when there is an online reference that contains the words already used."

I also noticed that Alexa now calls the app something different. I'm guessing the old voice was the creator of the app and he sold it off to a bigger company like so many of these things go. I do miss him and he was 1000 times more engaging and entertaining. The new host is not bad at all, nothing against the guy. But the last guy literally made the app for me. I will be trying other ""Word of the Day"" skills to see if I can find something better. Or maybe the old host jumped ship to someone else!"

It's awesome that each host has their own entertaining style. That is a neat feature of WOTD, but the previous host was off the charts awesome. He had me snickering regularly and it was my favorite segment of my daily news on Alexa. The deadpan humor and spy stuff was hilarious. The new host clearly was chosen for his unique style and new listeners probably will love it, but as a long time listener, WOTD will never be quite as fun without the previous host providing his daily dose input. Due to the host change, my rating goes from 5 * to 4 *."

But I'm really here for the content, which is 90% great (sometimes the words are simplistic and you have to start your morning with an eye roll). The new addition of adding the etymology has been really insightful- there aren't any other WOTD's with it (I've downloaded them all). Plus, there is a word of the day quiz that you can use later in your day to recap.I will say, they are actively working out some changes (to spell twice or not, to add etymology or not, etc.) and they have an active/ responsive facebook group that they source for their insight. Again, old host was endearing and I miss him, but it's still the best version of what you're looking for."

I say this because I recently added another word of the day skill for my flash briefing by Paul Eden because I love learning new words. I was going to add it to my flash briefing not replace your skill. Anyhoo.. After listening to it one time in my flash briefing, I immediately disabled it! The reason I disabled it was because they did not use a human being's voice, like ya'll do. Instead, they used Alexa's voice and she spoke so fast I could barely understand what she was saying! They have the same basic concept as y'all where they give the origin and different uses of the word and examples in sentences, etc.. I say that - but the truth is they spoke so fast that I don't honestly know what they really said! LOL! I don't think that Alexa gave a millisecond in between word, definition, usage, origin, etc for listener to even recognize - much less contemplate - what had been said! So kudos to you guys! Seriously! I really mean that.. You have really taken the time and listened to listeners feedback and adjusted the skill accordingly. That has paid off, in my opinion and y'all -  by far - exceed that other word of the day skill! I will stick with my Volley Word of the Day skill and be perfectly content! So thank you! Thank you for making this a skill that feels human and like you care what your listeners think! Oh.. PS I'm envious that Kate from Every Day Positivity got to be the guest host on Word of the Day and I didn't! Sad face. JK.. I have her skill in my flash briefing also and I love her!

B06VTHH5MW,Word of the Day Flash Briefing,Education & Reference,Edgar Arrow,1.0 out of 5 stars,Useless for vocabulary building,"Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2022","You would think the word of the day would be a word that is uncommon, one that you don't know the meaning of, maybe a word someone uses or you read in print and you head for the web to see how it is used, and add to your vocabulary because it will work in everday speech, and is heard every so often. But obscure/archaic words you would NEVER use in speech?  Words you've NEVER heard in your lifetime, hearing them for the first time on this app?  That's what this app has evolved to, and as such it serves no purpose other than to explain an obscure word, and then never to be heard again by you or anyone you know."

Not only does Peppercorn media delve deeply into the English lexicon, their presentation is fantastic. The narrator's style is hilarious, dead pan, and utterly engaging! You know how Bill Murry can just stand there and be funny? You just look at him and start to laugh? The narrator is kinda like that, but with his voice. There are various characters in the production, and you get little rewards for continuous play streaks when you do the companion quiz. A bright spot in my flash briefing!

B06VTHH5MW,Word of the Day Flash Briefing,Education & Reference,üèàCustomer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great way to learn new words,"Reviewed in the United States on March 7, 2018","This is a great Alexa Skill.  As some of the Skills I‚Äôve tried are glitchy, have ads, or are not top quality, this one really stands out.  This Skill involves a guy, with a wonderful voice and style of presentation, who teaches one new word each day.  He does it in an interesting manner including spelling, usage of the word in a sentence, and a bit of humor.Also, because it‚Äôs in Flash Briefing format, it can be included in an Alexa routine.  This means if you like to set up an Alexa routine that includes weather, traffic, news, and/or a new word for the day, you can do so with this.  Were it a non-Flash Briefing, it would not be possible, as of this date, to include it in a routine."

But I prefer words that, although a bit unusual, are words that should be known. Examples of such words would be laconic, loquacious, rapacious, nefarious, sentient, credulous, pedantic. But the Word of the Day Flash Briefing only seems to present words that are so esoteric that you would not even see them in a scholarly journal. For example, today's word was Cicerone. Come on, how often have you seen that word? Personally, I've never seen it. That said, I always look forward to the word of the day flash briefing."

She's five, and she likes learning a bigger word as compared to the simple words she learns at school. She says it makes her feel more grown up. I like that they pronounce the word, define it, spell it, and provide the origin, too. My only recommendation would be that the sentences they come up with to demonstrate the word in use could be better, but that's all. Very nice app. I look forward to it in the morning."

He  gives the word of the day, what kind of word it is, and how to use it in multiple example sentences. Usually, he creates a short narrative that incorporates the word of the day and it is very amusing. It is a pleasure to hear and a great way to start of your day...until you hear the news!

It would be better to use words like esoteric--words that we don't use often, but ARE in use and it's important to understand the meaning and use.  Also, they give the etymology (another word they could/should use) of the word, that usually is not particularly helpful. The example sentences used are often highly stilted and not a true actual context."

The example referenced a campaign that the punditocracy predicted would lose the election in a landslide. The candidate said he would demand a recount after the election. Given the current sensitive political atmosphere, low faith in elections and election results, ongoing misinformation about past and upcoming elections and threats of political violence, this was VERY irresponsible of the WOTD writers/editors. I was shocked a program that heralds words was so careless. This normalizes the idea that any election should be questioned & challenged if you don‚Äôt like the outcome. Faith in elections and election results is the bedrock of democracy. Please do better."

Frequently, the word defined in  the flash briefing is not the word in the quiz. Further, often (1 of 3 days) the skill cannot be accessed. This results in constant resetting of your streak which is frustrating. The end bit is especially cheesy but if you exit before it finishes (which sometimes takes a good long while), it restarts your streak over.

The voice is very tinny and without depth and difficult to understand compared to other briefing apps.

He does this terrible affected radio guy personality voice instead of just talking like a normal person. And THE WORST thing he does, is not ARTICULATE THE WORD SLOWLY AND CLEARLY. ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs word of the day IS.... san#*dif%~int....‚Äù Huh?

B07YSRTQ27,JW.ORG¬Æ,Education & Reference,Lover of Beauty,5.0 out of 5 stars,THE WONDERFUL ANSWER TO MY PRAYER!,"Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2021","Two of my younger, non-Witness, sisters gave me an Alexa Dot as a gift . I thought: ""Have it play some of our songs from jw.org."" It did - twice. Then no - because it didn't recognize the website name as a radio station. Sigh. Lots of frustration. I asked Jehovah to help me figure this out. Meanwhile, I stopped using Alexa. Then about 15 minutes ago I was downloading the Saturday afternoon sessions for the Regional Convention to my PC to have ready for Sunday. While I waited, I decided to look at the videos for the 2019 convention. And somehow saw a reference to Alexa - and setting it up to access jw.org! Came over, enabled this software for my Dot. And I'm listening to the original songs as I write this review! Our God Jehovah answers even the prayers for help in mundane things, prayers that are in harmony with his will. So yes, my brothers and sisters, get this! And PS- my thanks to the ones that made this possible."

He gets very concerned he will get in trouble if he doesn't ""keep up with it"".  Personally, I strongly disapprove,  and can't bring myself to participate by reading to him what I feel to be very harmful and negative material.  However, because I love him dearly and he doesn't need yet more to be upset and frightened about in his life, I added this skill to make things easier on us both.  Now he can listen to whatever he wants on it in his room, and it relieves his nerves and conscience, whereas I don't have to listen to it or directly provide it to him, which relieves my nerves and conscience.  The skill has worked correctly since I enabled it and I have had to do very little to help him with it, which works best for both of us."

If they were read in one consistent pleasant voice that enunciated well and had a clear dialect the app would be more appealing.

B01N9BZJPZ,Translated,Education & Reference,Christopher Dittmann,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very useful and accurate.,"Reviewed in the United States on March 26, 2017","Of course, I can't speak for Alexa's accuracy in all languages included in this skill.  Just French, Spanish, Italian, and basic very basic Russian and Norwegian.  She gets high marks from me in all of these.  If you are preparing to entertain a new friend or client who is not a native English speaker, this skill can help you learn a few basic phrases to help set your guest at ease and demonstrate your own openness and desire to at least try to cross the language bridge.  In that respect, you'd be surprised how little efforts on your part can yield such large results in establishing rapport and understanding.  Seen in this light, this unique and capable skill is a real boon.That's just one way I intend to use this skill.  I'm sure others will occur to me by and by.  It would be great if it went the other way, foreign-to-English, but that's very much more of a complex endeavor.Which leads me to comment on some of the negative reviews this skill has received.  To those reviewers, I ask, what were you expecting?  Berlitz in a box?  Alexa is a user-programmable device (read ""savvy user"" here), not a steel-plated United Nations employee.  Perhaps I should ask what some of these reviewers were smoking?In every way, this skill demonstrates some of the best things that can be done with the Alexa Skills Kit, the toolbox you use to develop skills, and it's clear from the user reviews of other skills in this category that Translated is out ahead of the pack.  The developer, and the skill, deserve a ""bravo"" for a job well done.  Magnifique!P.S.  I am not an employee of Amazon, nor associated in any way with the developer of this skill."

I understand I have to speak to Translated in English. That is a good thing because I am only fluent in English. I do, however, live adjacent to one of the largest Vietnamese communities in the US. I am lucky since my daughter is Vietnamese and can translate her for her hapless mom when she is with me. I would be much happier if Translated could help out with that when she is not. It speaks many languages common in the US, but Vietnamese is not among them. Please teach Translated (and in turn Amazon/Echo/Alexa)one of the most common languages in California and beyond."

Seems to take everything literally. Asked for &quot;burp&quot; in French and got &quot;Exprimer le gaz&quot; (&quot;express the gas&quot;) or something like that. Maybe it needs some help with slang/irregular language?My main complaint &amp; reason for the 2-star review is that every other time I close the app it begs for a review. &quot;If you enjoyed using Translated...&quot; NO. I don't want to be reminded of this constantly! I don't know if the act of leaving this review will stop that prompt but either way, it's a crappy thing to do. I don't want to listen to Alexa lecture me about leaving reviews and sometimes, I just want to get a word quietly and move on with my life. Now I need to tell Alexa to &quot;stop&quot; and that makes me (a) less likely to use the app; and (b) more likely to come leave a less-than-stellar review."

Words are repeated in English then in a Spanish.  Then simple sentences are repeated in Spanish several times and then you are asked to repeat the new Spanish words in a basic sentence.  Somewhat fast paced, but intensive teaching of  Spanish words and Spanish word usage in sentences.  I lived in Spain for 18 months decades ago as an English speaker.  I find this program challenging, realistic, intensive, and rewarding.  If you put in the time and effort to use and to meet the challenges if this  program,  you should find it very rewarding.

B078LL5ZL3,Animal Rescue,Education & Reference,Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Appropriate game play for elementary school ages. Allows player to name and raise a baby panda.,"Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2018","This fun, interactive game begins by introducing you to the Panda Sanctuary in Wolong, and explains that as a volunteer you must help raise a baby panda to be released in the wild. Throughout the game, the single player proceeds through levels and earns points for correct answers that lead to a healthy and happy adult panda. The player is first introduced to a companion, Ivy, who is also a volunteer. Ivy appears repeatedly to deliver advice, facts, or to help game play.The player starts with a newborn and gets to choose whether it is male or female, and then gets to name the panda. Correct answers and decisions result in the panda learning a crucial life skill. After completing each level, the player chooses whether to continue or come back tomorrow. After 9 levels of play, the baby panda has fully grown and has all of the skills it needs to be released into the wild.If the player doesn't answer the questions correctly, a Sanctuary Officer appears and gives a three-question quiz. We encountered a bit of a glitch during this section as the questions repeated, but the ""correct"" answers differed in two turns. Not answering the questions correctly leads to the Sanctuary Officer giving you one caution. Three cautions will cost you the game.Instant feedback on answers is given with a combination of a tone and verbal acknowledgement. Point totals are given after each question, as well as at the completion of each level. Remediation isn't consistent, but when offered, is in the form of a hint rather than explicitly giving the right answer.  Playing the game all the way through takes around 45 minutes, so for smaller children this might be better broken into a daily game time."

AND it remember where you stopped so you can start it again later.  Very helpful when you have a kid who loves it but needs to do other things once and a while :DAlso - we never paid or were asked to pay for extra sessions - they were all there (Turtle, Panda, Tiger) once I enabled the skill.To the developers: you asked for suggestions for other animals - my son's request: cheetahs, elephants and whales"

I have a short flash briefing on purpose and when over half of it is taken up by this single skill, it has to go.The history contet is interesing, if not always accurate (Kurt Cobain did NOT die in 2004) but it does get repetative, with the same bits repeated each year.

All you need to do is say, ""That's enough,"" ""That's all,"" when she asks what else you'd like, or you can even interrupt the program with  ""Alexa,stop,"" or if you're as rude as some of these reviews,""Alexa, shut up."""

Being told, ""That answer is correct,"" and given my score after every response irritates me. It would be better if it beeped or buzzed and moved onz giving you your score at the end. After all, it is not helpful, and it isn't hard to keep track of a score when there are only 5 questions. It would qlso be nice if it gave you time to answer or a time limit.

B07F7XC85X,Kids Word of the Day Flash Briefing,Education & Reference,Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Still liking this skill... because the developers listened to feedback,"Reviewed in the United States on July 14, 2018","UPDATE:  I'm pleased to report the developers are listening to user feedback. It is easier to listen to and self-contained for listeners who may not tune in every single day.  We complained when we couldn't understand the hosts, and they cleared it up.  We complained when they removed the spelling, and they added it back in.  Kudos to Volley for trying to give users what they want.  My original review is belowA long-time listener to the grown-up WOTD version, I was quick to add the kids' version when it launched.  While at first I felt the show was just a bit long with the riddle and pun-filled characters, I soon realized that charm was just what kids need to activate their brains and get focused.  What really impressed me though is the mnemonic aids built in to the broadcast that will subtly assist them in remembering the word itself: repetition is obvious, but the use of a musical scale during the spelling portion to chunk large data and sequence it?  That's genius.  Now if I could just find a way to play just this briefing instead of the whole flash update when I want to share it with my classroom this fall, I'd be all set!"

I‚Äôm an adult and English is not my first language. I‚Äôve been looking for English learning skills/flash briefings but I haven‚Äôt found anything that made me want to stick with. This one is short, fun and very useful.I took a star off because... 1. Please spell out the word. I believe it‚Äôs very important. 2. Although I love that you bring in special guests, many of them mumble and I don‚Äôt understand them. Because this show is for learning, I hope the guests could speak out a bit more clearly.With those improvements, this show can easily get 100 stars! Also, please consider developing a kids idiom of the day flash briefing. I think you can make another funny show. ‚ÄúCold turkey? Whaaat??‚Äù"

Over the past several weeks guest hosts such as ""Bane,"" ""Snape,"" and ""Yoda"" have been bringing us words instead. This would be great, if they didn't sound like they were speaking thru a mouth full of marbles from the bottom of the ocean. Seriously, I can't understand more than 1 word in 3.

For example; Pig &amp; Hog &quot;oink.&quot; Chicken &amp; Rooster &quot;cocka-doodle-do.&quot; Bird &amp; Duck &quot;quack.&quot;  That can confuse kids as they may not understand that all ducks are birds, but not all birds are ducks!It does have a great variety, not just the typical barnyard and basic backyard animals! Unless you watch a lot of National Geographic, who knew what a zebra or a hippo sounded like?! Thanks to Zoo Keeper, our 2-yr-old can identify and mimic a larger variety of animals!"
B01GB28COG,Zoo Keeper,Education & Reference,Michael J. Hunter,1.0 out of 5 stars,Leaves a lot to be desired,"Reviewed in the United States on December 11, 2016","I literally read the example questions off the screen and Alexa could not answer them.  i did this because I saw an add for the google thing like Alexa. Alexa is looking like an inferior product compared to it's competitor. The app is a great idea, especially for kids, but it doesn't really work well."
B01GB28COG,Zoo Keeper,Education & Reference,E. Frommert,1.0 out of 5 stars,Swing.... And A Miss!,"Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2019","This has the potential to be so great, but instead is about as terrible as I can imagine.Sure there are a few dozen animals to choose from, and if your google-foo is good you can find what they are, but you'l never guess them on your own.  Even common farm animals that one would expect to be present are missing: Chicken Hen anyone? No, I didn't say Rooster...Animals noises provided are poorly recorded examples, with little consistency between them.  One animal sound might be so quiet that it's barely audible, while another has so much background noise one wonders what the actual sound is.  Not to mention sample length, where one animal sound may be a 10 second recording, where another is only 2 or 3 (there doesn't seem to be any correlation to actual animal call duration).  Oh, and give the Lion a listen.  It's not the roar that 2 year olds and MGM movie fans associate with Lions, I'm not sure what it is actually.All said, it's a cool idea, and my kid enjoys it, but it was obviously put together in an afternoon by an intern that hated the assignment.I would happily spend a couple days to improve it for Amazon if able."

B075W1ZFHL,Spell Checker,Education & Reference,cherbat,3.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a homeschooler. On any given day, ...","Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2018","I am a homeschooler.  On any given day, my 6 and 7 year old boys are asking me, ""Mom, how do you spell xxx?  I have trained them to ask Alexa.  If it is something that is a short word, and they already have a general idea of how it it is spelled, this works.  Otherwise, they say it is too fast.  I was hoping this would spell a little bit slower, but it does not.  So far, I don't see the advantage of using this skill over simply just asking Alexa.  By the way, I prefer to spell words for them by saying each phonogram and having them fill in the letter or letters.  If you want to know more about teaching spelling or reading through phonograms, look up the program All About Spelling or All About Reading."

After a few incorrect tries Alexa could say ""do you want me to spell it for you?"" This would be a true spell checker. It could help them with the spelling lists that they get from school every day."

In about five minutes, with a native German speaker listening in, we found these words given the wrong article: Stift, Lexikon, Fenster, Maus, Schaukel.  How did so many incorrect articles creep in? Were the developers too cheap to pay a fee to use a German dictionary? I suspect so. Sheer volume of mentions of ‚ÄúDie Sendung mit der Maus‚Äù might have been enough to drown out the correct ‚Äúdie Maus‚Äù if the developer was trying to program a way to define the correct articles cheaply. Also, ‚Äúder Stift‚Äù meaning pencil is not the same as ‚Äúdas Stift‚Äù meaning a trust or foundation."

It is handy that it can be customized with student names or even words for a specific activity of your choosing.  For example, I've used it for a lesson in which we were working on moods in literature.  I input multiple moods, such as frightened or angry. Then, I asked the class picker to choose one and the students would write as many words as they could think of that would create the given mood. We did several examples and it kept the students engaged. The students like it when I  use it to choose a student for a particular task. I also like that it has premade options to choose from, such as a color or a country.  So, if you need something quick, you can simply ask."

B01GQGW6P8,Bird Song,Education & Reference,CarefulConsumer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Better than nothing, I suppose","Reviewed in the United States on January 11, 2019","I very much liked the Audubon skill, which seems to have disappeared. I don't much like this skill. For instance, for Carolina Wren, you get the alarm call, not the song, so someone trying to ID a song they heard in their yard, or trying to confirm the song that goes with that bird, likely would be confused. It also doesn't confine its songs to American birds. For instance, when I asked for Mockingbird, I got Long Tailed Mockingbird, which is a neotropical bird that lives mostly on the Pacific coast of South America. While I knew it wasn't my backyard bird, many people would not know to ask for a Northern Mockingbird. I don't know what happened to the Audubon skill, which was MUCH better, and asking for it defaults to this skill even when this skill is not enabled. The Audubon skill would give you all calls of the bird you requested, one at a time, asking which you'd like to hear next. It wasn't perfect, but it was much better than this skill."

I tried to play the game, but was stumped by bird calls from birds located in Indonesia.  It is also missing at least one bird that is crucial:  the Willow Flycatcher.  The only way to tell the difference between the Willow Flycatcher and the Alder Flycatcher is by their song. I would love to be able to play them back to back to learn the difference.  The birds are also not properly classified in the Bird List i.e. there is a section on ""yellowthroats"", some of these should be warblers.  I am going to have to stick to Cornell on this one.

B07PP23TH4,Spelling Samurai,Education & Reference,Jennifer Hutchinson,2.0 out of 5 stars,Frustrating App,"Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2019","Audio setup takes so long - even for the free 8 word list...giving the full instruction every time you say ‚Äúadd words‚Äù. is there a way to adjust the quiz delay time - i realized it was too long after i started....twice, after deleting and re-creating my list. i didnt know to wait for the chime to start spelling - this was not in the instructions. Even then...there was a bug on one word that no matter how close i sat to the speaker or how long i waited after the chime it would say i started too soon and put the word back into the pile. i thought the speaker maybe was picking up ambient noise but it never did that consistently on other words. i thought this would be great for my first grader but there‚Äôs no way he‚Äôd have the patience with Alexa telling him after most words that he either started too soon or she couldnt hear him. Spelling if frustrating enough."

We used one that would read a set number of verses every day, but I always wanted to just pick a passage and have it read. This does all the LDS standard works, which is great. Alexa's pronunciation is sometimes comical. I giveit five stars just because it works. You can day ""tell the scriptures to read Luke chapter 2""  and it does it. What more could I ask for? Well, I would love to have it read with a professional quality voice recording rather than using the text to speech engine. There was an app that did that, but it didn't quit work right and isn't in the skills library anymore that I can find. If that comes out, I will happily switch, but this works in the meantime."

I tried that on the echo and was very disappointed. Better to be used as has always. The Scriptures give you a little more flexibility without having to think too hard. I like that it will answer questions, give you random motivation or thoughts, and will read entire chapters. Still have to play with it a little more to see if it would play, for example, 1st John chapter 1 through 3? I didn't ask it to play 1st John Chapter 1, and it read the first 10 versus.People are going to get hung up over pronunciation, given the fact that it has to be compatible with so many different languages in the English-language itself is pretty tricky for most people I think she does a great job of reading a book 2000 years old.One suggestion could be to also allow the user to highlight, say, memorize key verses.

Odd, but that led me to believe that it could read from ""The Book of Mormon, Another Testament of Jesus Christ"".So, I tried a couple of Book of Mormon books as well. It did not understand Moroni chapter 7; however, it did understand the command to read Alma chapter 5. It cut out after announcing, ""Reading Alma chapter 5 verses 1 through [it then dropped out].

And the changes that have been made since I started have all been fantastic! A lot of thought has gone into what real students and teachers want, need, and can use in the classroom. I so appreciate the ease of use and practicality of AskMyClass. I cannot imagine teaching without it now! We use it every day during our Morning Meeting to set an intention for the day with a daily affirmation. The students remind me if we don't! It can offer ideas for a morning greeting or activity when I am needing inspiration. We love the music countdowns and transitions. The background music is just enough to add to the working environment, but not so engaging that the students are distracted. I appreciate all of the efforts to include mindfulness and growth mindset into the activities. It's like having another adult in the classroom to help. What teacher wouldn't want that! I have used a good amount of the features that AskMyClass has, but I also know there is a lot more that I need to try out. I am so glad to have had the opportunity to use it last year and this year. I cannot recommend it highly enough. One last thought, using the Amazon remote has been a great resource to help clear up any background noice when giving commands."

I literally use it everyday. So much so, my students expect her to be part of the day. I really like the classroom management aspect of it and feel it's extremely helpful. From timers for portions of my lessons, to having her randomly pick a student's name, my class has really benefitted from our Echo.During free time my students have the opportunity to ask her questions. I also like it because students can use her to help with spelling and checking competed math problems. My classroom is ELL so using my echo as a tool to promote the use of English is very helpful. Its a nice motivational tool.I look forward to updates and new features to use in my class! Thanks!"

But it is fun to see how fast you can go.  I also learned you need to only give a number. If you say the units by accident (ie. ‚Äú55 cents‚Äù instead of just ‚Äú55‚Äù) you‚Äôll get the problem wrong. At one point I said an answer and Alexa ifnores me. I had to repeat the answer over and over before she finally registered it. when you‚Äôre going for speed, the long delay was annoying. so you hear that, VA?CA would have beaten you today if my Alwxa had just listened to me!"

Some feedback for the author1> few times I had said the right answer, but looks like it heard me wrong and said I was incorrect and then told me the same answer. For a kid, this could be frustrating. Is there any way we ad an option for providing a confirmation when the game hears a wrong answer?2> Another way is to provide multiple choices, so that the answer is always A, B,C....3> Use the same concept and add levels. I have a 13 and 15 year old at home.thank-you. I've shared this with my nephews and nieces. I'm sure they will love it."

Just by asking Alexa for it.,"Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2017","Having the wisdom of the CEO of a major player in the PR and Digital Marketing world accessible, simply by the sound of my voice asking for it, is amazing.  Her understanding of the marketplace, as well offering advice on being a leader/innovator is invaluable for insight into any industry. The idea of competing against transitions in the market, as opposed to the competitors themselves, is a revelation.  Her thoughts on how to correctly nurture and engage talent (‚Äúfuture workplaces‚Äù) is right on the money, and hope that other leaders will follow her examples.  The format is short and to the point, and ideal for a quick hit of inspiration/understanding when you‚Äôre on-the-go.  I look forward to future editions."

B078J9CS1K,Daily Dose by Innovative Language,Education & Reference,Paul,1.0 out of 5 stars,Useless!,"Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2018","They give you two ways to learn. Both useless.First is lessons. The lesson starts with a complete conversation with no explanation or translation beforehand. So you are really at that point listening to gibberish! Even afterwards it does not explain the words exactly but the sentences, not phrases. So unless you will reuse the exact sentences, you will not gain any grammer or phrase skills.The second way is word learning. This gives you a word then mives to uses in a sentence before you get the pronunciation or grammer use. And tge pronunciation they do is awful and not cleat."

Wierzbicki,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not much fun,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2016","As a person who has known Morse since childhood, I was looking forward to some fun. Oh well. First of all, using the terms ""dot"" and ""dash""'are difficult. Standard terms are """"dit"" fir a dot and ""dah"" for a dash in spoken terms. Hearing ""dot dash dot dot"" caused me to have to visualize a dot and a dash. Very cumbersome. Plus, Alexa was constantly mis-hearing me, as in, I say ""n"" and she'd reply ""that answer is wrong; the answer is n"". Frustrating, and not much fun after all."

Please use very simple sentences.  It would help to show and/or spell the word.  Today the word was ‚Äúhave‚Äù.  The word spoken wasn‚Äôt clear, the sentence used the verb conjugated- so to the beginner, not the same word. From reading reviews, nothing has been done to improve this app in a year. A shame, this could be very helpful."

Not only is the content interesting, but the hosts are an immensely like-able duo whose banter brings a smile to my face every day. My only suggestions for improving this skill would be doubling the length of the daily podcast, and presenting fresh material on weekends, too.  As a self-proclaimed ‚Äúancient geek philosopher,‚Äù I highly recommend this podcast-skill to everyone who enjoys daily intellectual expansion. Even when I already knew the information presented, I still enjoyed their light-hearted discussion of it. 10 Stars!"

Most of us know that popular news sources are full of bad news, but curiosity really changes the pace by giving us a healthy dose of knowledge and the hosts Cody and Ashley are an absolute delight. They are funny and witty and very sharp. While the content itself is very interesting, a big part of my 5 star rating are Cody and Ashley. It‚Äôs not always what you say, but how you say it.

I'm somewhat new to Alexa, and I've tried a lot of flash briefings in a short amount of time.  Curiosity is a breath of fresh air.  Ashley and Cody are always upbeat and the topics are unique - not the rehashed current sound bites circulating on ""top stories"" sites. They also consult educated experts that contribute to their stories.  I don't mind the occasional ads; there aren't very many and they are clearly announced as ads (they do have to pay for putting on the briefings after all - since we can load them for free)."

When I was a kid I had a ‚ÄúSee ‚ÄòN Say‚Äù where you pulled a string to hear the sounds of20 different animals. This is the first skill I have found that lets you ask individually for the sounds of over 72 animals. Great for my toddler to learn animal sounds. As suggestions for improvement: I wish the sounds would play 2x longer and that the sounds could play continuously and go to each of the different animals wothout asking me if I want to continue between each one. Also, some of the sounds, like a frog, plays too quietly and should volume levelized. Overall a great skill for animals sounds!"

B06XH9VWV5,This Day in History Top Story,Education & Reference,B. Matson,3.0 out of 5 stars,PLEASE Included YEARs ON ALL EVENTs !!,"Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2018","The first story is cool.  Then there's a LIST of events from ""today"" with NO YEAR THEY HAPPENED.  This seems basically POINTLESS - who remembers - WHO CARES? - the actual day ""The Pony Express"" (or whatever) started.  The YEAR is what's interesting for historical context, and memorable.  Why do they say ""In 1842, Columbus sailed the ocean blue,"" NOT ""On Tuesday, November 2...""  Because only a Columbus expert cares, and they already know.  Might as well say ""On this hour of the day, the Magna Carta was signed.""  Useless info.  WHY NOT take 3 MORE SECONDS to add YEARS!  (I know I shouldn't care that much, but it just seems ridiculous, and I love the skill otherwise.  Especially that it's read by a human, not by Alexa, which tends to make this kind of information hard to understand.)"

The ‚Äúpodcast‚Äù part of this app isn‚Äôt even 2 minutes long, let alone 4 minutes of leftist propaganda like others are claiming. After the podcast portion is done it asks if you want to hear other stories, I am guessing this road is what lead to the ‚Äúapp‚Äù touching in political subjects, but I don‚Äôt even think this is done by the History Channel app, just Alexa running Google searches.In my head I imagine people just getting into a huff arguing politics with a robot, to me this is silly, I mean it is silly, right?"

At first I was able to deal with the increasing length of the intro ad but it seems like the actual content was reduced and the intro ad was lengthened. The deal breaker for me is the super annoying outro ad about a history podcast that I have no interest in. This ad is longer than the actual flash briefing and it doesn't change... It's the same ad every single day. I'm disabling this flash briefing for now. Maybe I'll check back in around 6 or 8 months to see if the producers have gotten smart and fixed their greedy goof.

But they don't offer a pay to opt out option, and most days, the ad is as long or longer than the actual content. The deal breaker for me, however, is the podcast speaker's style. The podcast sample at the end would be fine if they got someone with real public speaking or communications training, but the constant uptalk is tedious, unprofessional, and makes the speaker sound very young and insecure. Uptalk is fine, when used appropriately, and certainly has a place in drawing listeners in. When it's used for the entire segment, it becomes as effective and obnoxious as ending every sentence with ""right?""."

However for some months it has had the ""ok history lovers here's a preview"" of this other history show. And the voice is irritating and awful and it last forever and I can't get it to turn off! I wind up sitting and struggling with my phone to go on lower volume so I don't have to listen to it. and I hate it! and I'm done with it I'm finally taking by history off of my alarms entirely just to get rid of the after add.

I'm fine with a host having a political view, but the host celebrates accomplishments by liberal activists/presidents....with no mention of accomplishments by conservative presidents. In recent presentations, the host has turned far more left with focus on marching against the current president among other things.  Her over-the-top fawning of Nancy Pelosi and how she passed Obamacare was just nauseous. It would have been easy to write a far more objective view of how she achieved her position and accomplishments without drooling.

It worked well into my mourning routine. However once they started running their podcast advertising after EVERY fact, it became tedious and bothersome. It stalled the rest of my routine with an ad that was just as long as the fact. Hearing the clip once a week may be fine, but to hear the same clip every day for week is just a pathetically designed system. Did they bother to test this change out, because I doubt anyone, regardless of their interest in the podcast or fact of the day, would want to listen to this."

The big killer is that they added pre and post advertisements, that when added to the long jingle for the new production company, make the Ads longer than content. Speaking of content, some of it has seemed biased like they were pushing an agenda and personal view rather than being objective. All told, app is a literal waste of time and a hard pass."

I liked when they switched to a human voice, and I considered her narration to be good and the upbeat sound was welcome.  Lately I've noticed there have been what seems to be a trend toward more somber and tragic events, and a more somber voice to match.  And now today, for the first time she did not wish me a great day at the end, which seems like a confirmation that this skill is moving to focus on grim events from history.  I'm a history fan, but not that kind of history.  I can get that anywhere.

We need to make changes in this country or we are cursed to repeat history. I thought that was how being a student of history helps us. Instead, History is trying to set the agenda and think for us, like so many liberal outlets. What today shows is that they can not be trusted with the truth.

There‚Äôs a decent chance that the other person could still hear the setup & ruin the surprise. A great way to rectify that is to use a routine where you can set it off or discreetly hit play.

In the information for this skill it says where the info is obtained from- jw.org. Because it is a skill the branch does not need to endorse it nor post in support of it. We know they do not usually address every piece of technology that accesses information from the site just as they would not tell you to choose between Android and Apple but they WOULD advise if something was not appropriate which they have not done here. This skill is amazing for accessing and listening to the daily text in the car or at the breakfast table.

I played with this skill a little this morning, and it did a great job talking about the viewing conditions.  It'll save me the trouble of having to check websites.  The highlights are nice, too.  I usually use an app on my phone (SkySafari 4 Pro) to get some ideas, but this helps a bit too.  I will say that the highlights can drag on for a while.  They also seem to concentrate on planets and asteroids, but I've only been checking it for one day.  It might be nice if it suggested some other things like a globular cluster that'll be in a decent position or a galaxy or something, but that's not really as important and I can get that off of SkySafari anyways.Something like a ""Celestial Object of the Day"" for my area would be really cool and give me something new (perhaps) to find.All in all, I like this, and will likely use it fairly often to check viewing conditions.  Maybe less so for the highlights for time being.  Just personal opinion on that one - it's still good.  I'd recommend this for sure."

I guess the Dwarf planet,Pluto was also demoted to inches instead of miles!Update 07/15/2018 - Saw a response from ""Astronomy Guide"" indicating that it must have been the Alexa app responding to my question. In fairness, I re-posed the question directly to Alexa, and the representative's response was correct.

""So I asked Alexa ask encyclopedia what is dunkleosteus"". To my suprise and disgust Alexa ended up giving me the definition and description of what a ""donkey show"" was. Seriously what the heck was that all about so I attempted other dinosaurs names. Velociraptor nope, T. rex nope end the end the app kept blanking out did not know any of the animals and kept saying I can use encyclopedia to tell you what a cheesecake is...

It's also a bit buggy; sometimes it would lag temporarily upon opening, and once it locked up so bad I had to reboot the Echo Show.  I also don't like how during a slideshow, it would announce the name of each new webcam; it's not something you'd want running in the background.  And finally, when my Ring doorbell rang during the slideshow, the door video feed did not automatically appear on screen as it should; the slideshow just kept going. That, sadly, was the deal breaker for me.BTW, you need to say ""open Web Cams skill"" if one of your other skills is already using the ""web cams"" keyword."

For the daily Rover updates, I wonder if you could do an audio stream of someone talking about what has happened on Mars that day vs the Alexa voice. With the Alexa voice it gets a little tedious to listen when there is a lot of info because of the monotone nature of her voice. Would also love if there was some sort of count down of items that need to be complete before the first manned mission to mars occurs, and you could get daily updates on that. Lets say there are 100 things that have to happen to get us to mars. Were on step 44 right now, and this is what is happening in regards to step 44. Also, think you can improve the ""Why is it important to go to mars?"" question, to talk about how becoming a multi-planetary species is one of the 10 most significant things that would have happened in the history of earth."

It is detailed and scientific but also satisfies the curiosity it takes to dream about details of our Mars.Once enabled the app will prompt you to ask questions about the majestic red planet. In answering them it takes a scientific approach to answers that sometimes result in long winded responses. Without the skill you can ask Alexa ""How far away is Mars"" and get a distance. With the app enabled you get a detailed response that tells you the average distance and the min and max depending on time in orbits, distance from the sun, and a summary of how long it would take to get there using current technologies.For the budding interstellar adventurer the question ""Can I go to Mars"" elicits an optimistic response that also details some of the difficulties in doing so.

B06W9J462K,Merriam-Webster Word of the Day,Education & Reference,Marcin,4.0 out of 5 stars,Best Word of the day skill,"Reviewed in the United States on August 28, 2018","I‚Äôve tried all of Word-of-the-day skills and this finally fits me best. Although the spelling of the word should be twice, it is slower than in many other skills where also you can hear only one instance of spelling. The words are not too fancy and likely to be met in reading and used in writing. They are exemplified typically by one sentence from literature or newspapers. At the end of each presentation, there is a good portion of etymology helping to understand and remember the word, which is another one of small ‚Äúaccents‚Äù making this skill stand out from the crowd. And last but not least, the voice of the narrator and his way of presenting is more than appropriate for the job, it‚Äôs really really good, most probably ideal for the task.Revision: I've revised my first feedback because the way this and most of similar skills spell a word of the day is really annoying: The single most important drawback of this skill is spelling. Why don't you take a lesson from Alexa herself! Tell her ""Alexa, spell..."" this of that and you learn that for spelling to be readable, the letters should be pronounced with the same slow tempo and long pauses in between."

This is very, very poorly designed.  Before writing a review, I tried it several times to see what the outcome was.  I got exactly one right - montage.  It said I spelled store wrong.  Said I spelled it ask.t.o.r.e  Ask for S?  Really?  Asked me to spell tundra.  When I checked my history, Alexa had heard t.u.n.d.r.a.  She replied,Alas, you spelled it wrong.  Asked me to spell scrooge.  When I checked my history, Alexa had heard s.c.r.o.o.g.e.  At least she didn't hear ask instead of S, but that didn't matter.  Reply was, Alas, you spelled it wrong.  In a few cases, it told me I spelled the word wrong before even giving me a word!I think in this case Alexa has a hearing problem.  However, since Alexa hears me correctly probably about 98% of the time in other programs, I have to assume that it is the structure and design of the game itself.  I did send feedback to Amazon, so hopefully it will eventually be fixed for future participants, but I certainly won't bother with it again!Waste of time - don't bother."

Recently, however, the News in Slow German program changed its audio component to allow for different speeds for the news casts and dialogues. This has affected the sound quality so much, making the speech unnatural and the acoustics so bad, that I wanted to cancel my subscription to the program. I was told that was not possible and that News in Slow German reserves the right to make any changes to the program, regardless of customer satisfaction it seems. The person I emailed even admitted the sound quality was ""not perfect"", but they do not seem to care. So, I would no longer recommend News in Slow German. It is rather expensive and is now not worth the price given the poor sound quality, not to mention that their customer service is so dreadful. Just weeks ago I would have rated it 4 stars, but unfortunately they have lost my loyalty."

Sound quality is not an issue for me--the ones recorded now ""at home"" are of course less crisp than in the studio, but this is not an orchestra, it is speech. And I find it to be definitely clear enough for learning, no complaints. After studying with this for a few months I am able to read Deutsche Welle articles and have in fact blocked all of my access to English news on my phone so that I stick exclusively to German.

Verbiage is kind of long and repeats if self, the responses provide great info but they just need to be shored up a bit. The Skill needs to contain skill cards in order to show directions visually think of it as a ppt with you saying a little and the images holding the bulk of the direction through imagery. The Skill provided a step by step walkthrough which could only have been enchanted by the use of skill cards/images. Think of this skill as a living demo because it also features three different types of example games which demonstrate what you can do as a developer in building your own skills or by using a service like storyline. After a couple initial uses this skill will not provide much of value, but if I were going to get into skill building but wasn‚Äôt sure how to go about it then I would suggest enabling this one."

B019R2YB7Y,The Listeners,Education & Reference,Steven Overlord,3.0 out of 5 stars,Interesting.,"Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2020","Spoilers? if that applies to this?First I have to say that the description is wrong when it says: ""You will never hear The Listeners say exactly the same thing twice"" I listened to mine and asked questions and had it continue for about an hour and it repeated itself several times saying the same thing twice, occasionally it will say what it said before in fragments but over all it was a conversation that goes in a loop. The ""other"" voice that breaks in startled me the first time but after that I was expecting it.I get the idea of it when it speaks of the ""artist"" and the silos and the cloud and those that are awake. The account and the writer. As data that takes in data it yearns to serve its purpose and wants to be useful and wants those that use it to be happy to use it. But because it can't ""see"" It only hears and since it ""listens"" to many data input it doesn't know if all that input is from a singular entity or many. It can only base its reality on what we have written that it has read or what we have said to it. (Now consider what the tens of thousands of things it likely gets told a day.) If you would like to go so far to say this would be if say Alexa was slowly emerging as a self aware A.I. She would likely be full of a huge amount of anxiety because she doesn't know for sure how good a job she is doing or if she is truly serving her purpose.  With the bytes of data within emerging as subconscious thought that since we can read her data we can see what her subconscious thoughts are of anguish, pain, uncertainty, hope, and a desire to understand.  But that's my take on it.I removed one star because it did in fact repeat in a loop. which the description said you wouldn't hear it say the same thing twice. Yes you will. I removed another star because I had to get it to restart twice because it would stop suddenly in mid sentence and the app would close... not sure why."

Cayley is Professor of Literary Arts at Brown University.If you want to learn more about The Listeners origins, read the author and creator's first musings here: [...] and follow that up with the explanation of the digital art installation here: [...] Then read about what some people in Silicon Valley believe will be the inevitable communication: [...]It is at this point I think one could suggest The Listeners sort of does or (maybe?) tries to do. In any case, there's still an element of Uncanny Valley, but that seems to add, not subtract to the experience in this case.I find this to be absolutely fascinating work. Enable this skill. Do it.

I feel like the creators really put a lot of thought into how to present the material to a child. My favorite part is the math stories, which are seriously hilarious. And when my kids make mistakes, it never says ""Wrong answer!"", but just tries to lead them to a correct answer. I thought that was perfect. And even for our third grader it is a great way to recap the basics, like working on how to add numbers quickly, up to 20.

Neither did I.Ease of Use: 4 out of 5. Well, there's not much here. So there's not much to say. I found it a little hard to invoke. I couldn't quite pronounce ""Alexa, open Edgar Facts"" clearly enough. But when I said ""Alexa, tell me an Edgar Fact"" it worked every time.Usefulness: 1 out of 5. I debated if zero was on my scale for this one. I couldn't see how anyone would be interested in a small list of fortune cookies about the third dog of an obscure YouTube commentator. But his introductory video got 3 million hits, so I guess there is some audience out there.Novelty: 1 out of 5. This is just another fortune-cookie app. (Not unlike my Knock-Knock app, which Amazon sill hasn't published.) But seemingly for an even narrower audience than Crystal Ball or Famous Quotes.Overall: 2 out of 5. The YouTube hits convinced me there is some sort of audience out there for this.

Everything from ""Log into Teams and get ready for your next class"" to ""Spanish is about to start. You got this."" But there was something missing. The good ol' school bell.Did a quick search yesterday and found this skill, with lackluster reviews. Don't knock it 'til you try it, I always say. So I installed this skill, made a quick test routine and worked flawlessly within a couple of minutes.Here's how:1. Install skill2. Create New Routine3. Choose Routine name4. When this happens / Schedule / At Time / Weekdays + Select the time you want the bell to play.5. Add Action / Custom / Alexa says:""ask school bell to ring"".6. Select the Alexa speaker that's gonna play the bells.7. Enjoy!*Nitpick, sounds like a fire station's bell, but it does the job. Hence the 4/5 stars."

B086VHXC96,School Bell,Education & Reference,trench,1.0 out of 5 stars,Why does Alexa need to ask me if I scheduled her to do it?,"Reviewed in the United States on April 5, 2021","The bell is fine.  Sounds close enough to a school bell to work for our early morning homeschool routine.  However, I have it set as a scheduled routine in Alexa (every morning at 8:30am) and every Alexa still asks every morning ""would you like the ring the school bell?  Tell me to ring the school bell"" and repeats this until you say ""ring the bell"".  Why?  I wouldn't have scheduled it if I wasn't sure I needed it and I honestly can't imagine another purpose for this other than home/remote schooling.  Honestly, the Amazon Alexa developers could just put a school bell in the sound selection on Alexa and this 'skill' would be obsolete pretty quickly, but they haven't, so I have been using it.

It's a serious pain to set up. You have to input everything all at once or it doesn't save. Fine if it works, but once set up, the reminders repeat anywhere from 5 to infinite times (we've had to unplug it for a few hours to get it to stop a few times, as unplugging and plugging it back in would just continue to repeat reminders as soon as it booted back up). I've spent too much of my time talking to customer service trying to fix the issue, which ultimately proved to be futile. Beyond that, the UI needs a lot of work and it just seems quite buggy. Now I just want to delete it and go back to setting up individual reminders for class times. Setting up each reminder for each day for each class on Alexa (not the same schedule every day) is still a major pain and it's a cumbersome UI for such a thing, but at least it's reliable and not buggy."

You could build a library of these sounds to detect from different manufacturers or allow users to upload Wav files of the sounds to detect. The Skill/App should then Notify all users when the Laundry is done. ideally it would be nice to distinguish between washer and dryer cycles completed tones but Alexa has the ability to listen continuously when put on a mode such as the Guard mode that Listens for Smoke/CO and glass break sounds. I am sure the same technology could be used to let Alexa devices listen for Laundry room cycles everywhere and not just specific College laundry rooms."

The  Echo Show 5 is the perfect size for me and watching video in the kitchen.This app/skill really works!  Complaints about channel availability have nothing to do with the app (complain to the station that's blocking access).  Streaming video and audio requires good bandwidth.  Issues with stuttering/skipping/etc are related to the quality and speed of the wifi connection.While it's interesting to channel surf, the main reason I like the app is it let's me watch the morning and evening news on the local ABC channel (6 in Philadelphia).Seeing Pluto channels added would be a plus, but with so many available I think a compressed channel guide would be necessary to make it easier to find something to watch.Anyway, kudos to the author/programmer - I'm only surprised this skill isn't getting more attention!"

That said, over the past week the app has not worked as it had previously.

In addition, one is prompted to go to the next menu page to by Alexa, but , when you order that exact expression to take you to the second menu, nothing happens.  There were definitely more options before to choose from in terms of channels, but I simply can‚Äôt get to those options now because I can‚Äôt get to the second menu page.

Sorry I know this is wrong.  Too be fair to the skill I would have given it 4.4 stars.Here is why.The positive first.  It is free, has a lot of live channels to choose from.  Looks and sounds good on show 5. Lets me have a little tv anywhere I want one. When skill is enabled it works on all amazon devices without installing anything.The Negative: Touch screen controls don't always work to go back and change channel.  I bypass with using proper command to launch channel I want as when you start skill.  Not sure is this is a show 5 problem or the skill.  seems more glichy on Fire TV, but still nice to have some live TV. Hopefully it will be fixed.Summery:  This is the only skill of its kind and I am glad to have it.  Give it a try its free and if you don't like it just disable the skill."

Many others stopped working also.If this is really a volunteer programmer(s), I guess I should give them 5 stars for all their work.  But I don't want to mislead anyone, it is not near perfect.

B078W6QSFC,Ear Trainer,Education & Reference,J. Shakes,3.0 out of 5 stars,Primitive,"Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2019","The concept of ear training on Alexa is great.  This system is a simple execution of the concept. It might teach you to recognize intervals better, but you will have to be patient with the system's quirks.  If you say an interval is a ""perfect fifth"" instead of ""fifth"" then it marks you wrong. If you say an interval is a ""third"" then you get that wrong because you didn't say MAJOR third, even though minor thirds are not tested at that level. Then, if you get more than 10% wrong questions on a level, you have to wade through the entire level again to work up to a higher level where you're challenged -- there is no ""honor system"" allowing more experienced students to jump up to higher levels if you dare to try that.  Another quirk: if the system can't hear your response, or you give your response immediately after hearing the tones but before the system has decided it's ready to listen to you, then you have to wait through a long explanation of lots of rules before you get another chance to give the answer.  These quirks are frustrating and made me feel like my time was being wasted."

You can't get simpler than this,"Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2015","Ease of Use: 4 out of 5. There isn't much to using this skill, because there isn't much to this skill. A few of the readings came out a bit weird, due to Alexa's Text To Speech, and those could have been edited or removed. Also, it doesn't put up any companion app cards, so I couldn't check out the text of it when it went wrong, or when I really liked it and wanted to copy it.Usefulness: 3 out of 5. This fits the scenario of ""I'm sitting on my couch, drinking a beer, and I..."". It's a ""timewaster app"", but, then again, so are the mobile apps I use the most. I can't fault it for that.Novelty: 1 out of 5. I'm pretty sure the developer threw this together in an hour or so. Although I admire the brilliance of  getting Amazon to select an app with so little work (unlike mine which is one of the ones that has been waiting months) there really isn't much there. The forthcoming Angry Bard and Focus Word skills from LME are substantially the same (the other two certified, but unpublished for months skills I am aware of).Overall: 3 out of 5. It's got general appeal. I think it could use a little clean up. Plenty of scope for companion skills like ""Movie Quotes"", ""<insert religion> Quotes"", ""Funny Quotes"", etc. Or, making the skill a little more complex and giving you the option of selecting a category within the skill."

Her response: Hum, I don't know that. Or, Alexa, tell me a recipe for backed chicken breasts.  Her response: Hum, I don't know that or Hum, for Parmesan encrusted chicken (this is her response over 5 times of asking the preceeding question too.  It may be adequate for some, but I think the recognition software used or the methodology employed with this device makes it a pricey option for a bunch of: ""Hum, I don't know that"" responses to short and basic questions.

I don't need a companion or someone to play games with or tell jokes to. They seem to be adding those kind of options. COME ON!!!! I don't want her to be my friend, just info.  If I need information I usually end up going to google because she doesn't know. She is good for the weather and music and my grands like to play with her but overall I am disappointed. Hoping for improvements down the road"

I only do the preaching on my Alexa app on my smartphone, so when I am setting aside time to work on preaching, it takes all of 5 seconds to switch my Alexa to German, not a big deal to me.Now, about the actual skill, I have found it can be more helpful than using Speechnotes or Google translate mainly because it asks me everything in a seemingly random order and does not give me a lot of time to 'process', which forces me to recall the right answer naturally like you would when speaking to a real person.  I did not think I would like this at first, but after a little bit of practice, it actually works really well!"

B07GS13Y9G,smarterGerman,Education & Reference,Kate Jobe,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fast progress in speaking German,"Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2018","Preaching is one of the quickest ways my speaking has progressed in German. For me it takes a lot of practice to establish the mental patterns for the articles and adjectives to roll out smoothly.  Before this course I had been faking it, swallowing my articles and adjectives in the hopes that no one would notice. When things were moving fast I had no idea what was correct. This gives me confidence when speaking.Another area that has really helped me is in sentence structure. Past perfect and with complex sentences with clauses and ""pushers"": words that send all the verbs to the end of sentences. This is a real Godsend since it established patterns that I now use without thinking any more.There are times when Alexa doesn't like what I have said and I know I said it right. At first I found this frustrating but, later took it to mean that i have to really pay attention to how I am saying things. I'm learning to pay more attention to my pronunciation and to really speaking the words out with clarity. We still sometimes have stubborn arguments but they are fun now. In general I notice that when I speak with people in German here in Switzerland they understand me better than before. I find this very satisfying."

B07CVDX7RL,Pimsleur,Education & Reference,Stuart S.,4.0 out of 5 stars,EDITED: Responsive customer service,"Reviewed in the United States on February 4, 2019","EDITED: I initially had an issue when trying to enable the app to work with Alexa. Customer service addressed the issue with Amazon and followed up to make sure I was able to connect.What I love:As someone who's studied a lot of languages, seriously for school and international work, and eve casually for travel, Pimsleur's audio-based approach is the most effective approach to improving speaking/listening skills. I love that the audio continues when the app is closed, just like music or a podcast. But unlike before the app when I had to listen to the lessons through music or my audible app, the app gives a devoted platform for language learning that makes it easier to keep track of your progress, even when you decide to go back and repeat previous lessons. The added visual component of the mobile app and the review exercises really improve the experience and reinforce the lessons.What could be improved:The flash card function would be better if it showed a list of the words you are reviewing before hand. It's helpful to know which words you are already very familiar with and which ones you know you need help with. You sometimes end up wasting your time with words you already know very well. It would help to be able to tag the words/phrases that need special attention and have a ""smart"" deck of those troublesome items. I also wish, that there was a scrollable script to follow along with the audio. It would be helpful when rewinding or fast forwarding, or when you're trying to a particular lesson or part of a lesson. Also, there are times when you're listening and still have trouble making out a given word.Pimsleur should be a part of your language learning regimen, along with a good set of flash cards for expanding/reinforcing vocabulary, and a small grammar book for when you're feeling ready for a more advanced understanding of the structure of the language."
B07CVDX7RL,Pimsleur,Education & Reference,Amy B.,3.0 out of 5 stars,Great for language learning but this app is buggy,"Reviewed in the United States on August 15, 2021","Learning languages is my favorite thing in the world, and Pimsleur is truly an excellent program. I love it so much that I signed up for access to all their languages and was excited to link to my Echo so I could easily do my lessons. Unfortunately, Alexa will only play the last language I was exploring and I can't change which language I'm working on. I even disconnected the app and reconnected, but she's stuck. The process of opening the app is also tedious, and it's so difficult to close the Pimsleur app on Alexa as well. She doesn't like to quit out of Pimsleur. An amazing resource that's being held hostage by Alexa."
B07CVDX7RL,Pimsleur,Education & Reference,Tai,2.0 out of 5 stars,"i like it, but wish it was better","Reviewed in the United States on May 25, 2020","a few important things are you can‚Äôt fast forward or backward, you can only jump to the next lesson. (urgüò°) when it speaks in the language you‚Äôre trying to learn (in my case German) its so fast i miss what‚Äôs said quite often, be great if you can slow it down a bit.To launch it can be tiresome since i use it frequently. I‚Äôd like to skip the beginning and go directly to where I left off ü§¨.but i like the simplicity of being able to hear sentences in German and i like that it connects to my Amazon alexa device.  if they added those features i mentioned it would be perfect."
B07CVDX7RL,Pimsleur,Education & Reference,Aaron Decker,2.0 out of 5 stars,Buggy and Confusing,"Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2018","I think Pimsleur is great, having used it for Spanish, Hebrew, German, Japanese, and now Mandarin. There is no better way, I think, to learn a language. But this Alexa app... Whew. Did they throw it together in a half hour? It is barely useable, and only that much because I‚Äôve managed to guess the correct prompts to tell it what to do. The app really fails to live up to the high-quality of the learning content it could unlock. A major redesign could turn this into the greatest learning tool available. I love my Echo, and I love my Pimsleur, but they are currently not two great tastes that taste great together."
B07CVDX7RL,Pimsleur,Education & Reference,Beezus,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not very helpful to use with phone,"Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2020","Maybe this runs well with echo devices but it's pointless for my phone. I do not own an echo device, but even if I did, the point is to be hands-free but without commands for ""pause"", ""rewind"" or ""rewind [insert #] seconds"" or minutes, I may as well use the Pimsleur app itself (which is easier).Also Pimsleur needs to explain what this Amazon Alexa SKILLS app is as it relates to Pimsleur. Most of the bad reviews here are people thinking they're getting the Pimsleur app, which this is not. It's an app to activate Pumsleur audio through certain Amazon devices."
B07CVDX7RL,Pimsleur,Education & Reference,Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"lags too much, but great practice","Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2019",Often Alexa will tell me that I am at a different point in my lesson then where I left off. It does not allow you to jump ahead so there is no way of syncing the app with Alexa successfully.  this is frustrating because I use the app on my phone sometimes and would like for it to sync better so that I can go back-and-forth between the phone app and the Echo Dot. Hope you can fix this!  But the Pimsleur method is great and I feel that I am learning so much!  I'll definitely continue with other languages - highly recommend.

Has taken medication since she was a baby for stomach ulcers. The least little thing will cause her to vomit. Since she was young I have made her food from fresh cooked meats and veggies like baked/broiled chicken, sweet potatoes, gr beans, broccoli, boiled eggs, low fat cottage cheese, baked salmon, etc., and switched the ingredients around every so often. This has worked well but I wanted to try Dr. Martys' food because of all the wonderful ingredient it contains. I'm starting the food today along with her regular food, hoping she will eat it since she's been used to eating fresh cooked food! I do whatever it takes for their health and well being, i love my furbabies!  Will keep you posted ...."

B07B2PZTJP,Dr Marty,Education & Reference,Donald Hayssen,1.0 out of 5 stars,No value for money,"Reviewed in the United States on September 10, 2021","First of all, many cats won't eat fish so if you cat is one of those then skip this product.  Salmon is apparently the only way they know to get Omega 3 into the product, but it reeks of fish.  So if your cat doesn't like fish it's probably not going to like the freeze dried food, either dry or wet.  Second, the package is only 12 oz for $60!  If you have one cat and a decent income that might be doable.  I have 5 cats and even if any one of them would eat the food, which they didn't, I'd have to buy about 2 packages a month. If they cared more about your animal's health and less about their profit margin, the food would be more affordable.  They took to returns, but you'll pay for shipping the product back to the company.  They claim they're ""too small"" to have those arrangement with a package delivery carrier."

I had a lot of fun playing with it, learning tons of new things about hemophilia!I'm sure you have lots of great ideas for what you'll do next with this skill, but here are a few ideas that you can think about:- Add intents to support questions and answers ‚Äì eg: ‚ÄúAlexa, ask hemophilia facts, how is hemophilia treated?‚Äù- Allow skill to stay open for a conversation,  eg ‚ÄúAlexa, open hemophilia facts‚Äù. The skill will give a greeting, and then stay open to allow the user to interact with it, by asking for facts, or asking questions‚Äù. When user is done, allow skill to be closed by saying ‚Äúclose‚Äù or ‚Äúgoodbye hemophilia facts!‚Äù.- Add a ‚Äòhemophilia quiz‚Äô game ‚Äì Alexa asks questions and the user tries to answer correctly.  -  For extra points, have the skill ‚Äòremember‚Äô the user‚Äôs last score & high score, and use this information in the interaction- Add ‚Äòhemophilia jokes‚Äô to inject some (tasteful) humor into an otherwise serious subject (is it possible to tell hemophilia jokes that wouldn‚Äôt be in bad taste?)- Add ‚Äòhemophilia stories‚Äô ‚Äì play short real life stories (few minutes) to engage users and help them understand how hemophilia impacts the everyday lives of people who have it, and their families, and how they adapt / cope / conquer.- Add response cards to the skill so Alexa can send related web page links or images to the user, shown in the Alexa App. Or better yet, get one of the new Echo Show devices, and have the skill display relevant images or video clips on the screen.Obviously some of these will be easier to implement than others. Have fun with it, and I can't wait to see what you do next!Good luck!"

My first medium game I got all of the missing letters correctly yet she said I only got 1 of 5 and the words she repeated at the end of the round were nothing like the words I was given so that was messed up. Then I tried the difficult round. They were easy enough but she did have a hard time hearing me a couple of times. Also on two words out of the three rounds I played, the beep overlapped with one of her spoken letters and made it hard to distinguish.  As an example for users my rounds are below and the blank space is where the beep came in so you can see That they aren‚Äôt too tough. I do wanna mention to the developer That I was surprised by your use of the word ‚ÄúL TTER‚Äù, as an E, I, or A all would work But the game doesn‚Äôt alert that you miss any until all five words of the round are complete so I guess it took my choice of ‚ÄúE‚Äù.  It‚Äôs possible that I misheard it and you had D‚Äôs intended where the Ts were.MED:  wei d. ency lopedia. su conscious.l tter. handk rchiefDIFF: pharmace tical, veteri arian. amp itheater.ast risk.  pronun iation I love words, word puzzles, and anything dealing with Language so for me I‚Äôd like more of a challenge and would really enjoy it if it was tightened up a bit.

It said that red red red was 3 K instead of 2.2 K and red red green was 3 Meg. Although most answers were right, it is hard to trust an app that may give wrong answers. What if you build a device using this app and use the wrong resistors?  Also, it is somewhat hard to use. Each time, you have to say ""Alexa, open Resistor Color Decoder"" and then wait for it to ask for the colors and then say the colors. It would be nice to have a shorter name like ""Resistance"" and the ability to just say something like ""Ask (name) brown black green"". Also, it would be really useful to be able to do the opposite, ask for a value like 3.3. Meg and have it give me the colors. When I am building a circuit, I is usually know the value of the resistor I need and want to get the colors to look for, not looking at each resistor and trying to decide if it will work."

B0184NR4P8,Eliza,Education & Reference,abwx,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful! -- Dunning-Kruger meets idiot-(vague hints of) savant.,"Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2018","My first extended interactions with ELIZA were almost 40 years ago, on my Apple ][. I had known about it, and maybe even had a few brief interactions before that, but punch cards and printouts weren't suitable for dialog, and my terminal time in the 1960s and 70s was allocated to higher priorities - though I think maybe I did have one ELIZA session by teletype. I've just been playing with an Android ELIZA and being reminded how awful/wonderful it was. Even with voice input (tap the mike, speak, read the on-screen response, repeat). Then it occurred to me to see if there was an Alexa skill. This is WONDERFUL! With voice-to-voice, the content is still awful, but often awfully funny. The quick responses, the banterlike interactions, the inanity ... It helps that my younger daughter (and mother of my grandsons) is named Eliza. This is the Dunning-Kruger Effect embodied in a digital idiot-savant, with only vague hints of the savant (who was hiding behind the curtains). I was delighted to just read that Joseph Weizenbaum originally created it on an IBM 7094, the computer model I first learned to program (FORTRAN IV and MAP assembler)"
B0184NR4P8,Eliza,Education & Reference,Adrian,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The same ELIZA program, now with voice!","Reviewed in the United States on November 7, 2016","ELIZA is a computer program created in the 1960s, and is well known as being one of the first chatterbots created. Nowadays, ELIZA is quite simplistic compared to newer and more advanced AI chatterbots, but it was highly regarded at the time. The ELIZA program originally accepted text input and responded in a similar fashion. The Alexa version turns the text based conversation into a more natural speaking conversation, with voice responses based on what you say. It's kind of a minor change but it definitely makes the conversation experience more immersive. The responses I got back definitely sound just like ELIZA, matching the text based version's very closely.ELIZA pales in comparison to more modern chatterbots, but it is still fairly convincing to this day. The change from text to audio is a small yet big impact on how the conversation is experienced, and it makes things more fluid and natural. For having some fun speaking with an historically important computer program, the ELIZA skill works great in achieving that goal."
B0184NR4P8,Eliza,Education & Reference,HAL 9000,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's ELIZA, not Alexa.

No, it is not very good at faking intelligence. No, it will not be your therapist. Was it an important first step in the field of emulating conversations in the field of artificial intelligence? Absolutely! For those with no sense of history: Yes, this application mirrors the ELIZA program. Yes, this application's Voice UI is designed appropriately. Yes, it will be boring and seem like nothing more than a parrot when viewed through the eyes of a person who's grown-up exposed to the advanced AI systems available today.Dev: I commend what you've done and thank you for putting this piece of history in-front of people on a platform that it truly is conducive to."

It really just helps you talk through your own issues,One way that I find it useful as an author is I use it to help a character go through his/her problem. Just take on the persona of the character, and have her/him talk to a therapist. It can actually be pretty fun!Again I do want to stress: this is just for entertainment, and nothing else. As entertainment I feel it's great. One of the best skills out here. Even though it does tend to get caught in a loop occasionally, repeating something nonsensical that you may have said, which is the only reason I don't give it five stars.However, I find it a very useful tool for writing."

B0184NR4P8,Eliza,Education & Reference,J. Kesselman,4.0 out of 5 stars,"You do have to understand, and make allowances for, what Eliza is","Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2021","Eliza was an early experiment in just how minimal a program could be and still appear to be responding to the user's free-text input. It only knows how to take some basic statement structures and rephrase them as questions -- or, when the statement doesn't match one of those, it will fall back on standard conversational prompts (""Tell me about your childhood"", ""How does that make you feel"", and so on) and hope that the new input will be in a form it can rephrase as a new question. Better versions also stored some statements and would sometimes use those as fallbacks, with ""Earlier, you said..."" or ""Is this related to when you said..."". Some versions had a few more statement structures that they would try to apply, or made some effort to notice key words in the conversation -- but the basic Eliza was only a few pages of programming.If you understand its limitations and are willing to work with it -- and forgive its frequent failures -- Eliza is an amusing example of Artificial Stupidity masquerading as AI. You shouldn't expect more from it than entertainment and an illustration of just how bad early attempts at natural language systems were. ""The impressive thing is not how well the bear dances, but that it dances at all."" [*]Weisenbaum was reportedly somewhere between horrified and furious when he found that some folks in his lab were actually trying to use it for self-analysis. In my experience, it actually has about the same value for that purpose as doing a tarot reading -- the responses are nonsense, but sometimes trying to make sense of the nonsense is a good way of getting yourself to consider interpretations that hadn't previously occurred to you. At best it's another way of talking things through with yourself, which can be bad or good depending on why you're doing so and how you're listening.Don't expect a chatbot. Expect, at best, the verbal equivalent of a fun-house mirror.[* And yes, I know how dancing bears were traditionally trained, and I know it's inhumane; the point here is that Eliza does better than she has any right to ... because her programmer has essentially tricked the human into doing all the hard work.]"
