In every episode, they explore a different topic ranging from video games to movies, latest gadgets and technologies to Comicon and Nutrition to top nerd stories.All three hosts give some interesting opinions and exclusive insights on various topics.

Also, the sound quality is great, and the trio‚Äôs focus on keeping the podcast to-the-point and engaging makes sure there is never a dull moment.One of the podcast fans says in their review on Apple Podcasts, ‚ÄúPete & friends discuss everything nerd related so we don't have to. Like, who wants to reminisce about working at Game Stop? Not me. Far too triggering. But these dudes got it all covered. Impressive seeing game devs come to talk about the industry. Love getting an inside perspective on a somewhat enigmatic & secretive enterprise. Keep it up, dudes.‚ÄùIn their latest podcast, the hosts discuss the game buying thought process and whether game remakes are a good thing. They also provide ‚Äònerd news‚Äô about Call of Duty, Anti-cheat software, Sony PS5‚Äôs rumored limited availability, and estimated price.For many of their podcasts, they have invited special guests, to give their expert insight on various topics. The most popular episode was their David Hayter interview where they discussed his experience voicing Solid Snake/Big Boss of the legendary video game, Metal Gear Solid and writing on the X-Men Films. One of the podcasts also features the best selling author Kylie Higgins, who talks about Batman, Nightwing, and Power rangers. For a podcast released in March, the hosts invited Michael Katz, the former president of Sega of America, to discuss his journey, video games, and more!"

I'm just going to say once you passed 60 questions, the questions will repeat what you've already answered. Every 10 questions, it gives a free blooper or a free lifeline. So, I'm already at 120 some, and I'm tired because I already know all the answers but they just repeat. (it's endless at this point).The free lifeline that is given to you must be used up in order to end the game. So, I deliberately answer the questions wrong on purpose to get out of the game and keep the score."

I think 80% of our questions were about directors of certain movies, the others were just about release dates.

And the sound of her laughter! It is a big hit with our kids. It is completely family-friendly, kid-safe, granola-mom approved. It's so easy for our kids to use, because you can ask it anything, and it answers exactly like you would expect the character Baby Groot from Guardians of the Galaxy to answer.Our kids are really tech-savvy, and it's nice that this feels so safe and innocent in a world where digital interaction can be so dangerous. We don't have to stand by nervously biting our nails, even after previewing it, because we're afraid we might have missed something that we would feel is inappropriate for our family.This is a really funny skill, and for an adult, I'll admit that the novelty could wear off very quickly. I'm not that adult, but I'm not normal, I suppose. I think those with kids in their lives would have a lot of fun introducing this skill to the kiddies.

B01DL8NNUQ,Seinfeld Fan Trivia,Movies & TV,C. Dixon,1.0 out of 5 stars,This show deserves so much better.,"Reviewed in the United States on September 9, 2018","The positives of this app are contained in the name: You get to answer trivia questions about Seinfeld, the greatest sitcom ever aired.However, the experience quickly goes downhill from there:- The biggest problem - way too few questions. If you're a big Seinfeld fan, you're going to want to play this more than just a couple times. However, you will quickly start noticing questions you've already answered, and soon after that you'll be hoping just 1 of the 5 questions is one you haven't heard before.- The App feels unpolished/unprofessional. Many questions contain clear misspellings that cause Alexa to pronounce words incorrectly. Many questions are phrased oddly or with poor grammar.- Some of the questions/answers just feel lazy. E.g. for a question to which the correct answer is the book ""Tropic of Cancer"", two of the wrong options are ""Tropic Thunder"" and ""Tropic of Thunder"".I'm not aware of any other Seinfeld trivia app/skill, so I really hope this one is revisited by the author. I don't know anything currently about creating Alexa skills, but I'd be happy to contribute to improving the quality of this one."

Movie Info, on the other hand, had a longer answer of the exact same info. Although either one is incorrect, one simply has to say ""Hey Google, then ask the question(s), as opposed to ""Alexa, ask Movie Info...."" or ""A!exa, open Movie Info...""

X-Men:  Apocalypse, Captain America:  Civil War and Deadpool.  It found ALL of them.  And the most amazing is that it found ""Deadpool"" after I had returned to listening to music and then said the phrase, Alexa, Deadpool."", and it returned to using the Skill as if I had never left.I asked it about the movie, ""Phantasm"" and it gave me a listing of all three Phantasm movies and asked me to choose which one I wanted information on.  That was excellent.  I wished Alexa as a whole could anticipate such logical sequences such as this.I asked it about the movie, ""Dr Phibes"".  This is an old, old movie.  It told me there were two movies with that title, ""Dr. Phibes"" and ""Dr. Phibes Rises Again"" and then asked me which one I wanted a description of.It is this kind of logical thinking and anticipation by the Skill and the author of this Skill that I wish everything in Alexa would have.I am not affiliated with Amazon and I do not know the author.  All I can tell you is try the Skill out yourself and you will see what it's like to have a Skill or something in Alexa that meets or exceeds your expectations."

All feedback is welcomed!Hi Bob, thanks for your review! You'll see in the description of the skill that it is not a game, it gives you the question and answer. I'm sorry for the confusion, I tried purposefully to get content that most casual fans wouldn't know to keep it interesting. If you're a hardcore fan like me, you may know the answers. What I will do in my next update is increase the time between the question and answer to give you a chance to guess to see if you're right. I am working on two new skills that will actually be a points based quiz game that has the ability to play against friends locally with amazon buttons and long distance against other players.

I just tried this skill with my Dot, and the burger was the Summer Thyme Burger. Get it? It‚Äôs easy when you read it, not so much when Alexa reads it to you. It‚Äôs not the developer‚Äôs fault that Alexa hasn‚Äôt evolved to have the appropriate inflections necessary to deliver all types of jokes. But I understand from other reviewers that the Echo Show‚Äôs video capabilities are a missed opportunity with this skill. Moreover, on the show, Bob usually completes his burger names with descriptions that at once seem obvious, until you realize from this Skill that it‚Äôs only obvious because you‚Äôve read his Burger Board yourself. These puns don‚Äôt come with the add-on, e.g. ‚Äú(comes with thyme)‚Äù. They should in a situation such as this. The idea is cute. But the execution is too close to how I order my own burgers, which is definitely short of being well done."

B072MQFFG6,Burger of the Day,Movies & TV,Kaini Chen,2.0 out of 5 stars,Needs Work,"Reviewed in the United States on December 20, 2017","Great idea for a Skill!  However, two main gripes:1.  The trigger phrase ""Bob's Chalkboard"" is not intuitive, and can be difficult for Alexa to understand, particularly if you speak with an accent.2.  This gives no option to display (for Echo Show or other video-enabled Alexa devices) or recite the recipes, and only gives the name.  This severely limits the functionality of the skill beyond a mere novelty.Looking forward to seeing some robust updates for this skill!  Lots of untapped potential, here."

Thanks to the creator James Gagliardi for porting Screen Test to Alexa. This is really fun and funny and brings back familiar memories. It provides great real clips of quotes from classic films each one followed by a short description.  It there is a problem is its success. The game is so much fun regardless of how many quotes they supply you will play and play until you are getting quite a number of repeats. But this happens with JackBox great game LieSwatter as well and its still fun.  Anyway Alexa is the best way to play trivia games at home outside of being surrounded by your family or buddies.

Examples : Arthur, O Brother Where Art Thou, Vampire's Kiss, the Godfather Part Two. Yes, repeats quotes too much.

I went into the game, which promptly glitched, and so I told my Echo to ‚ÄúGo home.‚Äù so I could restart it. It thought I was saying the answer and said I was wrong. It did not play the quote for the next round and so when I told it to ‚ÄúQuit game.‚Äù it told me I was wrong again. By then I had already deleted the game through my phone and had to unplug my Echo and plug it back in again just to get me out of a stupid game."

B01MUAESMO,Screen Test | Movie Quote Quiz,Movies & TV,Lisa522,4.0 out of 5 stars,Really fun game but as the others said,"Reviewed in the United States on May 15, 2017","Really fun game but as the others said, there are certain ones where she will not accept the answer even if you say it EXACTLY as she does.  Also, certain movies - Misery and Kindergarten Cop, in particular- she never gets right.  For Misery, she will say Missouri... wrong.  It's Misery.  Duh, that's what I said!  For Kindergarten Cop, she always seems to think we're saying On The Garden Path Cop.  It's funny the first time she misunderstands but no matter how clearly you enunciate, she still gets it wrong with those movies.  Other movies (the majority), she gets correctly.  My husband has even SUNG the answer Goldfinger (to the movie's theme song) and she WILL accept that so there's hope, lol.  Please add more quotes and try to stick to WELL KNOWN movies as we play this game a lot and really enjoy it.PS - to the developers, a future project that would be great fun is naming a portion of a well known song's lyric and guess the song title.  Hint, hint!  Can't believe no one is doing this yet.Thanks for a fun game!"

B07F8VC9F9,Emby,Movies & TV,Curtis M Gustafson,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works well with effort,"Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2019","The skill actually works pretty well - I really like the ability to transfer the stream between players - but the invocation name is a pain. You have to speak the invocation SLOWLY and treat it as three distinct words: M. B. Home (hit the M hard) to avoid errors like ""the skill is no longer available"".  Alexa seems to be unable to distinguish between ""m"" and ""n"" when listening and tries to interpret by context - unfortunately ""Emby"" really doesn't have an obvious reference so it usually guesses wrong and tosses an error instead. Hate to see the developer have to redo this a third time but also don't quite understand why Emby needs to be in the invocation as opposed to a more easily distinguishable name.  Alexa sounds nothing like Amazon, Bixby isn't even close to Samsung...the important thing is to make it work properly and conveniently for the users or it causes more harm than good for the product's rep.UPDATE: With the addition of routines in the Alexa app you can bypass the clunky invocation by creating a routine that opens the Emby skill. I use ""Alexa, connect to media server"" and it responds with ""Emby here, I am listening"" and you can use the skill directly and without the ""Ask M.B. Home"" invocation from there. Much more convenient and far fewer errors."
B07F8VC9F9,Emby,Movies & TV,TulsaTV,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Works, but extensive setup required","Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2022","As noted in another review, you need to assign your Emby server a fixed local IP address. You need to know what its external IP address is as well.You will need to have Emby Premiere, current a one-time charge of $119.You will need an SSL certificate. I currently use the free ZeroSSL. You must renew it every 3 months. After 9 months, you will need to create a new account with a different email address.You will need a domain where you can assign a CNAME and A records. I use Freenom. You get a domain free for a year. Then you need to get a different domain under your same account. However, if you use ZeroSSL, you will need a new domain every 9 months.(The above is a zero-cost, though labor-intensive way to go. You could also pay for a domain and SSL cert and not need to revisit the setup every 3 months.)After a change in the Emby skill a year or so ago, I found that I needed to use internal port 443 in the Emby server setup. I also had to port forward external port 443 to internal 443 in the router.In 2020, I had to go into Control Panel/Firewall and allow public access for embyserver.exe.Keeping all that in mind, there is a document online that lays out how you do it:Search for ""secure your server"" and ""Emby"". The article is on the support emby.media site, starts with ""This is a quick tutorial on how to secure your Emby server for free.""It's great to have this working for when Plex does an update that breaks their Alexa skill. The Plex skill is much easier to setup, but tends to have more glitches.Good luck!"

B07F8VC9F9,Emby,Movies & TV,Thomas Farrell,1.0 out of 5 stars,Requires static IP and connection to internet,"Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2021","To function, it requires that your Emby server have a static IP and connection to the broader Internet. If, like me, you have dynamic IP in your home, when you try to make it to anything, it says that it can't find your emby server, and if you've changed the IP address you should reload the skill. (Given that this happened first time I tried, it's useless.) Also I have a pretty good firewall, so the outer world can't see my emby server at all. However, Alexa is inside the firewall, and so is Emby, so there's no reason they can't communicate. Except that the skill doesn't work."

I asked it on a Thursday to play ""Thanks you notes"" and in the speech Jimmy noted ""It's Friday today..."", but he doesn't do that bit nightly.Upcoming guests is a bit clunky. It does not yet default to just tell you Tonight/Tomorrow's guests, instead it states the time the show airs and then prompts you for a specific day of the week.Overall the skill is a solid way to consume the monologue."

There are some people that  like or not like the fact that Alexa does cuss even though you guys tried to stop her from cussing but there are certain words in our language that can still be used as profanity like stupid., pussy, crap,retarded,retard,EXT. those are all words that people use but yet you still have it on so it's only fair that it should be a decision for ourselves to use profanity and or to not use profanity should be enabled or disabled function button that we could use cuz cusses in this world so I think that when we create things for Alexa to say one should just take it as humor and others to just take it as. it's something for humor"

B01MRKGF5W,MovieBot,Movies & TV,Paul L. Vasquez,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty Good,"Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2018","You can hold a decent conversation once you open the skill (NB Once you start the skill you are in ‚ÄúMovie Bot mode‚Äù meaning you no longer say ‚ÄúAlexa this‚Äù and ‚ÄúAlexa that‚Äù which is pretty cool and makes it possible to have something like a conversation with it.  Problems:  1) As with most of Echo, it has a heck of a time recognizing foreign names.  It wouldn‚Äôt recognize Akira Kurosawa, for instance, but I got in the back door by remembering some English film names, but it‚Äôs tough to get bio details.  It recognized ‚ÄúYojimbo‚Äù surprisingly, but not Toshiro Mifune. 2) It uses IMDB (Yay!) but any non-standard names it won‚Äôt get.  A comedy by Cary Grant is ‚ÄúThe Bachelor and the Bobbysoxer‚Äù but no matter how I pronounced it, Alexa only kept searching for ‚ÄúBobby Soxor‚Äù which of course doesn‚Äôt exist.  If you can‚Äôt get Alexa to get the right word, of course, a voice search is pointless.  3) The Bot also doesn‚Äôt recognize natural pauses in conversation, so the conversation can seem stressful or rushed if you don‚Äôt know exactly what to say next.  All of that being said, the syntax is far more like natural speech than any other skill on Alexa!  Kudos to this app for thinking out of the box!"

No longer.  I have about 30 titles in my combined queues and none are available to ship.  But, they let me put the movies into the queue, go figure, just providing false hope.  Netflix doesn't pay to get movies into their queue anymore.  For the last couple years you could get movies faster on REDBOX.  Now you can't even get the movies.  Netflix clearly has shown its colors, streaming it the way they have gone.  I canceled my account.  Switched to Amazon Prime."
B0859LXK6X,DVD Netflix,Movies & TV,Wolfy,1.0 out of 5 stars,TV Programs Missing Seasons,"Reviewed in the United States on January 26, 2022","When Netflix loses a contract for a TV program, they remove the seasons they no longer can get from their web queue. However, too bad for a customer who goes back to the program in the future. What happened to me with Grey's Anatomy is that they lost the contract and removed all the seasons they had after season 12. So, I bought season 13 from AMZ thinking I hadn't rented it. However, when we started watching it, we realized that we had already seen it.  But, I had no way of knowing it as their History database isn't easily searched unless you use the Find command on browser.  Same thing happened to me with Chicago Fire and Chicago Med.  If you decide to go back to a TV program, be sure you search your History before you decide to buy a DVD set.  I already talked to a Netflix manager about this problem and she said she would bring it up at a management meeting.  Meawhile, I'm stuck with three DVD sets I already rented."
