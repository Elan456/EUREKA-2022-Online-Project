The range of recommendations is limited and seems to focus on very basic choices, like the kind of meat being served, as opposed to being able to recognize specific recipes.  In a test of ""not usually with wine"" foods, it had a recommendation for tacos, but not for either hamburgers or hot dogs.  When you stump the interface, which is often, it won't stop asking if it can recommend something else . . . no matter what you say.  You have to say something like ""Alexa, stop"", which is just bad, sloppy programming.  OTOH, when it works it gives a short, to the point answer with a little bit of flair; if they can expand the menu items covered and tweak the interface, it would be a nice skill, so I'm going to keep it for awhile and hope they're still working on it."

B06W57KWQC,Recipe Speak,Food & Drink,PMR,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Lots of potential, but far from practical","Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2020","I wanted to like it‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs not practical. A good idea, but you guys have to go back to the drawing board. To start with, the fact it has to give me instructions on how to use the skill EVERY time is quite annoying. And I have to wait it to stop speaking before I can voice any new commands. Second, I wanted something that would guide me through my recipes: this skill seemed to be it, but I have to pause it during the instructions, while I follow them ‚Äî and sometimes it just quits and I have to restart the whole thing until I got to the point where it had stopped (remember the annoying talking? Yes, I have to go through them all over again). To make it better, get rid of the instructions on how to use the skill, unless I need them (‚ÄúAlexa, walk me through the skill‚Äù or something). Then, allow me to say ‚Äúnext‚Äù while it‚Äôs still speaking. And finally, allow me some minutes before I say ‚Äúnext‚Äù: don‚Äôt just quit the skill and have me restart it from step zero. Again, I really wanted to like this skill‚Ä¶"
B06W57KWQC,Recipe Speak,Food & Drink,Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,A Good Echo Show Recipe Keeper,"Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2019","Having tried several recipe programs on my new Echo Show 8 the RecipeSpeak skill is by far the easiest to enter my personal recipes in. Entering my personal recipes was very easy and straightforward: just cut and paste. The skill was easy to link with (you need a free RecipeSpeak account) and easy to call up. Showing all of the ingredients for a given recipe in small font and the specific ingredient being discussed in large font is helpful. The commands to move around/through the recipe are easy. Having a printable voice command guide made getting up and running simple.  The skill accurately translates the printed recipe into verbal directions. I have not tried downloading a recipe from the internet, so I have no opinion on that feature.There are two reasons for the 4 versus 5 stars:1 - When stepping through the instructions it only shows the current one. Frequently I plan ahead when working on a recipe; the RecipeSpeak skill should show the current instruction plus 3-4 following steps.2 - Frequently the description section of my recipes has tips and tricks for preparing the item. The RecipeSpeak skill doesn't seem to have an option to see the 'Description' section of the recipe even though you can add it in on the website.I forwarded several suggestions to the support staff and received a nice, and prompt, note from them in reply.Overall I am quite pleased with this skill and look forward to using it more often.Update: I received an email from the RecipeSpeak support people; they implemented my first suggestion. For me, at least, this improved the skill's usability. I am bumping the rating to 5 star based on support staff communication and skill improvements.  I look forward to other options being added in the future."
B06W57KWQC,Recipe Speak,Food & Drink,misty,1.0 out of 5 stars,Tedious and mostly useless.,"Reviewed in the United States on April 21, 2018","I'm not impressed, and I'm very disappointed that this is the only such skill app that lets you use your own recipes. There's no way to add an image or photo of the food or ingredients or process. It defaults to listing the ingredients one by one, and forcing you to say ""next"" just to go to the next ingredient on the list. I found out you CAN say ""show me all the ingredients"" and it will do so, but you can't actually view the recipe. So all this does is store ingredients, and in the most tedious way possible.Someone really needs to come up with something better. I want to be able to access my stored recipes. I don't care about skill apps for recipe websites if my recipes aren't there. Being able to call up and view my recipes was the main reason I bought the Show to begin with. I thought that would be an intuitive thing for the maker to include."
B06W57KWQC,Recipe Speak,Food & Drink,Bookworm,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great,"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2020","I like it so far, using it on my tablet. Three improvements: ability to turn off the command guide during the recipe (no more next or pause instruction before you can actually answer). Assume ""pause"" is the command after each step, since the user response to move to the next step is the same - music could automatically start after a set period of time has passed without a command. And allow alexa to answer non-recipespeak questions and commands and then return to the recipe, without havng to exit and restart recipespeak. I wanted to know if green beans should be stored in water, but in order for alexa to answer, I first had to exit recipespeak in the middle of my recipe, re-ask about grean beans, reopen recipespeak, find my recipe again, and go through all the steps until I reached my place in the recipe again. What a pain! All of these improvements would create a better user experience."
B06W57KWQC,Recipe Speak,Food & Drink,Mike Fanchin,4.0 out of 5 stars,Best game in town so far,"Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2019","Maybe they improved it because I had no problem setting up the account, linking it, entering a simple recipe online, and getting Alexa to repeat it back within 15 minutes. It reads out the list of ingredients one by one but it now only prompts you to say 'next' after the first item.  Additional inbstructions have been added that make navigating the GUI more friendly, including the ability to list ALL ingredients, add items to your Alexa shopping list.  They now have a ""cheat sheet"" at recipespeak.com that lists all the voice commands you can use and allow you to enter aURL, if you have one, that Recipe Speak can import. It would be cool if Recipe Speak could open dxz files instead of me having to copy/paste them all from my now-unsupported Living Cookbook."

Come to find that it does NOT allow you to see your personal recipes from AllRecipes.com, that skill is just plain broken, and it appears that they do not care.  So I found this great little skill and it is working for me!  Sure I wish that I could add a photo or it did this instead of that. BUT you do realize that they are providing you this service COMPLETELY FREE to you right?  Just the ability to add your personal recipe on their server for you to access anytime AND it works on the Echo Show.  That makes it 5 stars in my book."

Enabled the app through my phone and signed up in the same process. Activated account online through email confirmation on my computer. Super easy to add my recipes through the Recipe Speak website (on my computer), even adding recipes from websites and then adding my own tweaks which I greatly appreciate. Did a quick test on Echo and seems to work well. Will take me a little time to learn the voice commands but there's a guide provided on the website. Looking forward to using the app."

I wish it would wait a little longer when I pause to find ingredients or prepare the steps in a recipe.  It would also be nice if it could show the pictures from the url's I have input.  I tried pulling up a recipe from the recipe name, but was only able to get it by searching for the ingredients.  I am hoping that the share option will let me share my recipes with my daughter when she opens her own recipe speak account.  So far this seems to be the best recipe app I could find to work with Alexa."

I also don't use other online recipe subscriptions, which I gather are not compatible with this skill.I do cut-and-paste recipes that I would like to use, and for those, it works quite well.  The ingredient list is not particularly useful, but you can say ""Go to Steps"" and the steps work quite well.  When I am setting up the recipe, I paste the quantities from the ingredient list into the relevant spot in the steps.  Then, I don't have to switch back and forth, and I am saved from the perpetual question"" ""Wait, how much chili powder again?""  I can have it repeat that step again and again, so I can also be reminded how much cumin, coriander, oregano, and will be reminded not to forget the salt.  That works pretty well when my hands are covered with flour or something, like the timer functions also work well when cooking."

It works pretty well when I wake up and tell Behmor to run Quickstart or Brew my Coffee.  Alexa gets the command right about 75% of the time, but there are other times it does not understand me (I don't have this issue with other Alexa commands).  But like a lot of other reviewers, I would like to see Alexa integrated more so that it can be part of a routine, e.g. Alexa start my morning, and Alexa would turn on some lights, turn up the thermostat, start some music, and start the Behmor.  Also, regarding the delayed start of Behmor, for now, I use my phone app to do that, not Alexa, so that skill is not crucial.  But the Routine feature would definitely be useful.  Hope Behmor can do more work to integrate with Alexa (it is a Behmor issue and impetus to program, not Alexa)."

Also not too impressed by Behmor support. They were my first stop and quickly punted the issue to Amazon.  I found later that it isn‚Äôt built into the skill, which i understand is a Behmor responsibility. Could have saved me time and considerable frustration if they‚Äôd owned it in the first place"

We had to try about 10 times and then it finally started to go all on its own. The software is awful. Bare minimum and then they must have said, lets rake in the money! I can safely say its a disappointment. We were 10 seconds away from returning it and I got the Alexa part to work by un-linking it from my wife's account, making a new account in my name and then redoing the entire Alexa setup. I also think its a bit odd that its an Alexa skill to control it. I would have assumed they would have just made it a smart device like an outlet or something. Alexa can only start the coffee brew cycle, so why waste the time with all this other stuff when it gives it no extra features. I would not recommend it."

Complete waste of time appears they have no idea what to do and I am not a priority.  Several emails to Behmor support was not helpful.  They assured me everthing was fine and it was an Amazon issue and they could not help.  Brewer works great in the app and coffee is amazing which I would give it 5 stars for...
B01MUYM4CF,Behmor Brewer,Food & Drink,Sean,2.0 out of 5 stars,Needs work,"Reviewed in the United States on March 15, 2018",Works great if you want to make your coffee right then and there. But why wouldn‚Äôt you just hit the start button or schedule it through your phone? It would be nice if you could schedule through Alexa and add it to a routine. So you could for example say ‚Äú Alexa start my day‚Äù and BAM coffee or
B01MUYM4CF,Behmor Brewer,Food & Drink,Peter Y,5.0 out of 5 stars,Does what app can't! Start a quick brew right away!,"Reviewed in the United States on July 28, 2017","The nice thing about this skill is that it is a morning coffee person's dream come true... you prepare the pot and brew settings the night before and when you wake the first thing you do is ask Alexa to start brewing your coffee... hit the snooze button and 13 minutes later your coffee is ready. Now that I've written it like I need to set up a scene that does the snooze part! What is weird is that Behmor's app can't even quick start a brew afaik... you have to re-enter the settings. So short of getting up and pressing the button on the machine itself, this Alexa skill delivers the necessary functionality to make the behmor worthwhile."

It's a skill, and an awful one at that, when it should be a device. I can't incorporate it into a routine, which would be most effective, can't do a timer, and you have to ask behmor to make coffee and run through a prompt.It is an expensive counter ornament.I go through coffee drive through more than I use this thing, which is a shame, because the coffee itself is excellent.Behmor really needs to get on this. I've had mine for 2 years, and this is ridiculous."

You can‚Äôt just say ‚ÄúAlexa start coffee‚Äù like the other pots. You have to go through a questions and answers session, something I can‚Äôt do that early lol. You also can‚Äôt run it with routines, old pot I‚Äôd say ‚Äúalexa start morning‚Äù the lights, TV, and coffee would all start. Not possible here. So I gave up and figured I‚Äôd set a timer like normal people and we can‚Äôt do that either, well you can but it doesn‚Äôt repeat so you have to go through the whole setup thing before bed every night, takes literally over a minunit of loading and questions."

I hoped this routine might give me a little information in my flash briefing to spur my imagination, and perhaps suggest additional listening or reading. I finally disabled the skill after 2 weeks of ‚Äòlectures‚Äô running 5 minutes or more, several so condescending and self-important, I told Alexa to stop halfway thru. This skill is fine if you have longer than a few minutes, such as a relaxing weekend. If you‚Äôre listening as part of your morning routine as you rush out the door, 5 minutes of droning about why we‚Äôre idiots for not owning a digital kitchen scale is too much!

However, while this app does what it says, it can't handle anything beyond the basis of setting a temperate on Joule, getting Joule's current temperature, and stopping Joule. I realize that this app (and device) are really new, so I'm going to just provide some suggestions for things I'd love to see for the app. Please, please keep developing this app!- Set a timer, ask timer how much time is left (would be great if it could wake Alexa up when time is up, but I realize there might be limitations from Alexa's end)- Tell me how to cook basic recipes (ideally enable me to favorite and create shortcut names for these. I.e. if I favorite ""Basic Steak"" in the app and rename it as ""Steak"", respond appropriately when I say, ""Tell Joule to cook Steak"". Something similar to the current phone app would be good (i.e. how thick is your steak? what doneness do you want?)- If my water is already at x degrees from being set on my phone, don't stop and reset the temperature to be the same amount, even when I ask. I've accidentally done this a few times."

I always have my phone near me so not too big a deal but for the convenience of it all this would be extremely useful to me especially when I‚Äôm prepping sides for my meal and my hands are wet, or oily etc.As someone mentioned I‚Äôd also love to request and see the ability to set Joul on a timer with or without Alexa.That‚Äôs about it really, no issues so to speak with the app or the skill or Joule, just much needed functionality.

The early version seemed to work better but it seems with each update it gets worse. I'll say, ""Alexa, ask Joule to cook salmon."", and the response is usually ""I didn't understand that"". Even if you say, ""Alexa, open Joule"" first, it still doesn't understand the command to cook salmon. It rarely understands the command, ""Alexa, ask Joule to set the temperature to 130 degrees"".  It's extremely frustrating and this voice control part of the app needs serious work.When controlling with your smartphone, it seems to work very well, however, although the templates for very common dishes are nonexistent. It's usually just better to set the temp and time manually via the smartphone.Chef steps, please work on the voice command section of this app!"

""Alexa, ask Joule to set the temperature to 131 degrees"" and ""Alexa, ask Joule to stop"" make my Joule a mostly phone free tool and that's exactly what I was looking for.Sure, there is LOTS of room for improvement with this skill, but the few commands that are already included make it much easier to use my Joule!"

If you open the Joule skill she asks what to cook and if you want to just exit the app, there is no utterance to handle it. All she does is repeat her question. I then say ‚Äúquit‚Äù and Alexa will think for about 5 seconds and finally quit.The feature set is nonexistent as I can not determine how much time as her response just tells me the current temperature and target temp.

""Julie"" works more often,  but I find ""sous vide"" is the most reliable name  to use when accessing Joule. When I use that name, at least I can tell that Alexa is forwarding the text request to the ""Joule"" skill more than 90% of the time.That said, I can't figure out how to turn the device off. { tell | ask } ""sous vide"" to { stop | turn off | power off } do not work. Sometimes I get the status report. Other times I get ""I can't tell what you want"".Marginally functional.But when it works, voice control is still easier than the Chef steps app."

Alexa will confirm the connection. That's where it goes a bit soft. Any logical commands or questions such as, ""Ask Joule to set to 135¬∞"" or, ""Ask Joule what the current status is,"" are met with, ""I know how to cook different types of steak, chicken and pork.

I told her to ‚Äútell Joule to cook a steak‚Äù. Alexa recommended the temperature for Medium-Rare which I accepted, she asked me if the meat was fresh or frozen (frozen) and she asked how thick (1‚Äù). She then told me to put the steak in for 1 hour and 30 minutes when the water was heated. The alarm sounded when the preheat was complete on both my phone and Alexa (nice touch). The only thing Alexa couldn‚Äôt do was to tell Joule to set the timer for the suggested time.  It may have been the syntax I used or maybe she can‚Äôt tell Joule to do that. At least Alexa can set my timer.Overall I‚Äôm happy with this skill. I may come back and give it 5 Stars once I‚Äôve been successful cooking a few more things."

I was skeptical about the value of voice control. But if you have multiple things going on in the kitchen,  voice control is the way to go. I have a big open kitchen. The Joule has no display. It doesn't need one if you have voice control, a phone and notifications on your Apple Watch. When I have a bigger tub with ribs or tri-tip going, that Joule sits in my pantry and is out of sight. I still can control it as it would be right there on the counter. Awesome!Maybe all of this is not for everyone at this point, but works perfectly well for me."

The size and function is perfect and I have not experienced any issues.  I am blown away with how powerful and quickly it heats to temperature.  (much faster than my Anova)  The magnetic bottom is wonderful as well and less annoying than using a clamp to secure the device to a pot.  Connecting it with my Echo Dot has been a huge positive as well and nothing is better than using voice control to change temperature or to turn off.  The only criticism I would have is that there doesn't seem to be control to set the cook time by voice.  If Joule and Alexa allow you to set the timer there is less than adequate instructions on either site.  Overall I am super happy I bought Joule and it certainly is enhanced with a $50 added Dot.

I dislike not having the option of controls on the devise as I now see the phone controls as something I prefer not to use - primarily &quot;bells and whistles&quot; category.  It is a set up to have food sit at unhealthy temps either before cooking starts or after it ends if you intend to use it remotely.  That means I will be home while using it and it is much more reliable and convenient to have controls on the devise.  The original Sansaire is preferable for accuracy and controls, but it's size does not compare favorably to the Joule."

I loved the skill when I first started using it, It gave me a great sense of freedom with my cooking. I have always enjoyed cooking but after the loss of my eyesight I had become very restricted in what I could cook. The only way I could try new things was to burden other people to find and read a recipe for me. The Allrecipes skill removed that need and gave me the ability to explore and cook on my own once again, Now that the skill only reads the first two steps and then tells me to go to the alexa app I am back where I was before. I can not understand why this skill was changed since it was so helpful to the visually impaired.¬†Please explain why you would modify a skill without considering the negative impact it would have on the visually impaired community."

B01N3MS7AV,Allrecipes,Food & Drink,Kathleen Neuman,3.0 out of 5 stars,Feedback for the Next AR Skill Update: Echo Show,"Reviewed in the United States on January 16, 2018","This skill has so much potential!! I hope this feedback is considered in the next iteration/update. I bought an Echo Show (voice + screen) specifically because I use a lot of recipes in the kitchen and I wanted a device that would pull up the recipe and the screen wouldn't time out, one that I didn't need to touch with my messy cooking fingers (i.e. my phone). And when I found out Allrecipes had a skill, i was stoked! I love All Recipes for it's curated community ratings and feedback on recipe improvements.This weekend, I made three AR meals with my Echo Show and ran into a few key problems that I think are easy fixes:- The step-by-step feature told me what to do, but didn't always include the correct ingredients on the screen, which made me have to go back to the beginning to confirm the correct measurements for specific ingredients not listed (this could be a larger fix - recipe translation from text to device).- In leu of the step-by-step being 100% accurate, it would have been a smoother experience to just have the full recipe and instructions pulled up on the Echo Show screen and I could tell Alexa to scroll down when i needed to. But every time I attempted to have the full recipe up on the screen, the skill timed out when I went to add an ingredient in the pot. Every time, I was sent to the Echo home screen and had to re-launch the skill.- I also don't need Alexa to keep asking me 'do you need more time on this step?'. Making a roux takes more than 2 minutes, I'll tell Alexa when I am ready for the next step.Overall, the timing-out is the most disappointing aspect of this skill for the Echo Show. I double and triple check recipes, it takes me longer to complete them (especially baking recipes where measurements matter), it would be nice if the script for this skill was more intuitive to the cooking experience. It probably took me an extra hour to get through all the recipes because i had to navigate the the shortcomings of this skill.Prior to using the skill, I was raving to people about how my cooking experience with digital recipes was going to be elevated in the kitchen, and how AR was going to be my digital cookbook. I had people considering buying a Show for that reason. I believe the future of voice in the kitchen includes screen support, people want to see recipes when they cook. And millenials are used to and comfortable with screens. If you make any tweaks to this app, I encourage them to be for screen-enabled devices. More people will invest, if the experience is a positive one. Thanks for your consideration."

And better than trying to scroll through a recipe on my tiny phone screen.  But the most recent ""upgrade"" that was made to this Skill basically made it useless. When I most recently opened the skill I had to sit through an explanation about all the new features, only to have it then explain that it doesn't connect to favorite recipes in my account any longer. I wasn't thrilled but assumed I could search for and find the recipe I wanted to make through the Skill anyway. Wrong! I tried searching a few different ways and not only did I not find the recipe I wanted it didn't even give options for something that might have been close.

This skill finds recipes easily, puts multiple options with images for my recipe searches on my Echo Show, and links to my all recipes account so i can always see my favorites.  That said, I have 2 little problems with this skill.1st: Linking your Allrecipes account requires a username and password. If you've created an account using Facebook info as your login, it won't work.  If you've created an account using Google as your login, you won't even see an option to use it.  I had to go to the Allrecipes website, ask to be e-mailed a link to reset my password, and only then was I able to link the skill.2nd: When a recipe comes up on screen, it only shows for about 30 seconds before going back to the home screen. I typically have to search a recipe 3 or 4 times to make sure I've covered all of the steps.This is still a great skill to use, even with its flaws.

It is just a general recipe skill that can pull random recipes from your search query, and I don't care for the way it even does that.  There is no way to go back properly, I have to completely pull out of the skill and then start all over. I'm trying Recipe Speak next to see how that fairs."

The third was for a chocolate cake!  When I looked at the cake recipe it contained none of the key words at all.  Not the word ""whole"" or ""instant"" or ""pot"" or ""chicken"".  How is this search algorithm even relevant?I bought the Echo Show for recipe directions.  Unfortunately it makes the Echo Show worthless in that regard.  I did the same search on Google home speaker and the very first recipe was exactly what I asked.  I plan to return the Echo Show and buy a Home Hub instead."

What these tutorials don't tell you is that the ""Link your account"" option has been removed from the skill, so the only way to view your personal recipes is by giving them to Allrecipes.com (you need to agree for them to be published on the site, which if you read the terms and conditions releases your rights to the recipe).Personally, I don't mind this since I'm not a cook, but you should definitely be aware of this before downloading."

Long story short, you can't. You will spend 20 minutes arguing with alexa while she shows you recipes that she ""thinks"" you'll want. For example, one of the recipes we loaded was for venison wontons. I asked her to show my favorites and she said ""searching for oil."" Now, English is my first language and I speak it fairly well. So how she got oil from wonton is beyond me.Bottom line, save yourself the headache and look at the recipe on your phone, tablet (electronic or stone) or computer."

That‚Äôs about entirely what I bought an Echo Show for, and I will probably return it now, unless I can figure out how to get them in the much better to use Alexa built-in recipe presentation app.(on an Echo Show) This skill is completely useless. It does not correctly recognize any voice requests or commands. Even simply asking for cookies gives a list of cakes. it wastes time reading off dialog rather than letting you get right to what you want. Even opening a recipe just tells you about the rating and main ingredients rather than getting right to the ingredients list and steps. There‚Äôs no button to get into the ingredients and instructions, and any voice commands I tried asked me about rating the app rather than getting into the recipe. Having sat through all the dialog, I say I want to cook it, then have to listen to more options rather than just seeing it right away. Getting through that, the presentation is awful, with it just reading through steps back to back until it‚Äôs done. Did they even bother looking at the default Alexa presention, which nicely shows the steps and ingredients and reads only 1 step at a time. A complete failure of app design when they had an example of how to do a much better job right there."

There is no ability to ask for clarification on a step, ie; if you‚Äôve forgotten the measurement of one ingredient in a step, you can‚Äôt ask ‚Äúhow much sugar‚Äù, and instead must have the entire step repeated.

I went through and added over 22 of my personal recipes and this will only display the first 10. It won't find anything not in that first 10. Just trying to get the skill to start was an exercise in frustration trying to figure out the correct phrase. For example, I would say ""Alexa, launch My Cookbook"" on my echo show and it would launch Facebook. I finally found that I would have to say ""Alexa, show my recipes with my cookbook"" and it would launch but still only show 10 recipes. It may be able to find other recipes but I am not going to spend hours figuring out the correct phrase. Some testing and some actual documentation on how to use it would be a refreshing change from most of these skill developers.

It was just one of those days where nothing seemed to go right, my wife was sick and the kids were crazier than normal. I was trying to manage the house, my job, sick wife and give the kids what they needed. Things seemed to be under control until about 3pm. I'm not sure if it was PBS's afternoon shows or that fact i served marshmellows and squeeze cheese for lunch but by 3:15 my house looked like a reenactment of Lord of the Flies.I had to calm them down. I had to figure something out. I was going to loose my mind. What can i give them? What can i make? WHAT IS IN THE PANTRY?  Thankfully i loaded the ketchup dip skill for my Alexa. I was easily guided through a recipe that made me look like Gordon Ramsey (with no cursing) to my kids. I gently placed the bowl and added a bag of chips. The silence was heaven. If only i had tried it earlier. Thank you ketchupdip.com"

I don't know what that means and I don't have the time or energy to dig around and find out.

B01D4F1J0M,OurGroceries,Food & Drink,hma95,5.0 out of 5 stars,This fit our needs better than My Chef!,"Reviewed in the United States on December 22, 2016","We recently bought 3 amazon dots, one in the living room, bedroom and kitchen.  I read about both this skill and the my chef skill and started with what I though would be better was My Chef.  I have prime and have my husband under my prime account, so essentially we have 2 amazon accounts.  We would have to ask Alexa what account is this and since my husband does most of the grocery shopping, would have to first change to his account so the items would be put into My Chef shopping list.  Well sometimes he forgot and the items he said would go into my AMAZON list.  Then if the item was more than one word it would list it as separate item, like ""garlic sausage"" it would put on the list garlic and then another item sausage.  So it wasn't working out for us.  Then I installed OurGroceries, LOVE IT!!  You can ""link"" accounts so that no matter what amazon account you are on, when you say ""Alexa, ask our groceries to add garlic sausage to shopping list"" it adds it as ONE item to the list and it adds it automatically to BOTH our lists and is always syncing with each other.  The best thing, when he goes shopping and crosses items off the list, since the list is synced on our phones, it takes them off the list on my phone app as well!!  Have had NO problems with it so far and it was exactly what we were looking for!!  No it doesn't have the neat pantry options or can see what is expired like My Chef, but OurGroceries has the features we want and use more than My Chef."

If you are drawing up a large shopping list it becomes tiring to have to say for each item ‚ÄòAlexa ask Our Groceries to put PRODUCT in shopping list.‚Äô The developers really need to look at this. That said if you have a large enough Master List then doing it on your phone, tablet etc., should be no hassle just leaving the odd product been added in via Alexa itself.My second, and its Amazon‚Äôs fault not Our Groceries, is that I can‚Äôt make it my default list as I‚Äôm sure many users would like to do. While it‚Äôs not Our Groceries fault it is a hassle which I‚Äôm sure readers will agree withOn a more positive note I found a major shopping list online broken down into categories e.g. Fruit & Veg and Baking produce and spent an evening filling out my Masterlist with this detail.  All the hard word is done so it will just require a few tweaks here and there and I should have all I needLike many others I think the ad free version is to expensive.  I‚Äôd willingly pay ¬£2, but that would be about it, especially if I can‚Äôt make it my default Shopping ListI also enjoy the ability to have more than one shopping list.

This Alexa skill lets me do exactly that at exactly the time I need it: when I'm in the middle of prepping a meal. Now, with my Dot near the kitchen, when I'm making breakfast and am close to using up all our eggs, I simply say: ""Alexa, ask OurGroceries to add eggs,"" and eggs automatically shows up on my default OurGroceries list. If it's something we get from another store (for which I've set up a list), I just as the name of the store. So, if we're running low in paper towels, ""Alexa, ask OurGroceries to add paper towels to Costco"" does exactly what I've asked and paper towels is added to my Costco list in OurGroceries. And the ability to do this is still so new (we've had the Dot for only a couple of weeks) that every time I do it, and Alexa responds ""Eggs have been added to Smith's"" I can't help but think, ""Sweet!"""

For example Alexa add the following items to Our Groceries shopping list Tea next paper towels next with the word next signaling a new item in the list.  Also it would be nice to select Our Groceries as the default shopping list app so that you would only need to say Alexa add to shopping list or if a different named list like Target Alexa add to Target shopping list item(s) versus having to say Our Groceries every time.  Would need the ability to return to Alexa shopping list as default if desired as well. If these features are added my rating will change.

You have to be very specific in how you add to the Our Groceries app. You need to specifically say ""ask"" or ""tell"" Our Groceries to add the item. Otherwise Alexa will respond that it cannot find ""Our Groceries"" and wants to know whether she needs to add a list. I have found it to be easier to just have Alexa add the ""shopping"" list and I can go in and and move it to the Our Groceries app in the correct catergory. Everything that I have actually was lucky enough to have it add directly to Our Groceries is found at the bottom uncategorized."

The skill works great.  I don't know why people are having problems linking it.  I would suggest for those people that they  make sure that they create a list in the Ourgroceries app on their phone and then set their grocery list as the default.  Then it should be as simple as saying ""Alexa, tell Our Groceries to add eggs"".  If that doesn't put eggs on your default grocery list then disable and re-enable the skill in the alexa app or on the alexa.amazon.com website.  Ours lost the sync once and this brought it back.I agree that it would be nice to be able to disable the amazon grocery list so that you could leave out the ""Tell our groceries"" part and just say ""Alexa, add eggs to Publix"""

Do that first and then add to alexa.  It takes a little while to remember the proper command set, but if you have simple list names and basic things to add it works awesome.  There's a few things the app itself is lacking, but as an add on for it I love it.Some useful commands:Alexa, ask OurGroceries to add <item> to <list name>Alexa, ask OurGroceries to remove <item> from <list name>Alexa, ask OurGroceries what's on the <list name>Alexa, ask OurGroceries if I have <item> on a listFeature request:ability to move items between lists - move <item> from <current list> to <new list>"
B01D4F1J0M,OurGroceries,Food & Drink,Robin,3.0 out of 5 stars,... would be no need to add a new app/skill like OurGroceries. I like the app but the downfall ...,"Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2018","I wish that Alexa would allow you to alphabetize and/or organize your shopping list and then there would be no need to add a new app/skill like OurGroceries.  I like the app but the downfall is having to ask Alexa to open the app, wait for her speal about what to do and then add your item and then having to do that every single time you want to add something.  Also, Alexa should ask you if you'd like to add something else no matter where what list  you put your item on instead of having to say ""Alexa"" for every single item. Since the OurGroceries is shared with the Alexa app it should automatically sync every time you add an item to Alexa's shopping list so you wouldn't have to say ""Alexa, open OurGroceries"".  If that would change that would be great and I would give this a 5 star."

That excitement was short lived when I found that you needed to add each item one at a time. This would be a lot better if I could call off the items and they all would be added all at once.There should also be a way where this app could be made to be my default list rather than having to remember to tell Alexa to which list I want the items to be added.

B01D4F1J0M,OurGroceries,Food & Drink,bayoubean,4.0 out of 5 stars,Has Possibility,"Reviewed in the United States on June 13, 2017","Has nice features and therefore possibilities.  Instructions with pairing other devices could be a bit clearer or easier to find, but that's a detail perhaps.Unlike the default Shopping List provided by Alexa, this allows you to create unlimited types of shopping lists (grocery, hardware, clothing, pets, etc) and within those lists allows you to segment by type of product; e.g. with grocery you can segregate by frozen food, vegetables, dairy, etc.  And once you label (or change it) a product as say dairy, it will be categorized as dairy in any list you've created.  Categorizing things in lists can be extremely helpful as usually when grocery shopping foods, household goods, etc are all in the same categorical area.This product has other features such as barcode by a particuar product that I'm not sure of the value of right now.This product has nice possibiliities, it will be interesting to see how user friendly it is in real life application."

B01D4F1J0M,OurGroceries,Food & Drink,Tony L,5.0 out of 5 stars,The BEST out there by far!,"Reviewed in the United States on July 28, 2016","I tried darn near every list app there and they all fell way short until I found Our Groceries. First, it works across all my platforms, Android phone, 2 generations of Kindle/Fire, and on my PC in a web browser. Second, I can create all the different lists I want and name them as I want. Next, I can pick different sort orders for the things that are on the ""Buy"" list and the things I have ""Crossed-off"" my list. The Crossed-off list I keep in alphabetic order to make it easy to find things. For all my actual grocery items I have assigned the aisle in the store as the category. So i sort the Buy list, by category and all my list is in the order I find them in the store. I check-off (long press) each item as I grab it. They item goes to the Crossed-off list for next time and my Buy List scrolls up. Perfect and simple!When this became a skill for my Echo I was thrilled, but there were a few problems at first. First problem, my echo was not always understanding ""ask Our Groceries..."". I looked at the Alexa app when it failed and found it was interpreting ""our"" as ""are"". So now I just say ""ask R Groceries..."" and it works great. (It must be my mid-west accent...)Second, when I would ask it to add something to one of my lists that was already on my Crossed-off list, it would create a new item (uncategorized). I contacted Our Groceries support and it turned out to be a issue that it was not recognizing capitals and lower-case as the same. They fixed it and I am a happy camper.While I am in the kitchen cooking and I discover I am running low or out of an item, I simply call out ""Echo, ask R Groceries to add butter to the Grocery List"". So nice not having to remember to put it on the list later or having to wipe off my hand to do it immediately.I have lots of list that aren't even related to shopping. For example, my Library list has 2 items - ""Pick up materials"" and ""Return materials"". When I get an email notice from the library I have something to pick up, I call out, ""Echo, ask R Groceries to add Pick Up Materials to the Library List"". Then when I look over Our Groceries' list of Lists (a daily habit now), I see the count is 1 and I am reminded I need to go to the library. I can do the same for my RedBox videos too. Very handy!I don't know why so many people gave reviews saying it didn't work for them, but I suspect the problem was not with the skill itself."

I believe that most people are having issues with pairing Alex with OurGroceries.  For me it was very easy once the skill was enabled, it asked for the my OurGroceries account info and that was that.  Best part is that I have multiple lists based on Ralphs, Whole Foods, etc..  You just say ""Alexa, ask OurGroceries to add organic strawberries to Whole Foods"" and she does it perfectly.  I do not maintain my lists from Alexa, only add and for this it is 5 stars!  It would be great to know what additional commands that OurGroceries supports with Alexa, but that is a common complaint I have with all of Alexa skills, such as Insteon and so on."

In an ideal world, we would be able to make OurGroceries the default shopping lists of the Echo, so we wouldn't need to use the slightly awkward ""Alexa, ask OurGroceries..."" line. But this is a current Echo shortcoming & has nothing to do with the Skill or the App Developer.You will, however, find that in most cases when you ask Alexa to add an item to a list, this will result in a new item being created & added, instead of calling up an existing item you've already created in the app. I suspect this could be due to the fact that in the OurGroceries app, new items default to capitalization (like ""Eggs"") but the skill adds the item to a list without capitalization (""eggs""). It's not too difficult to delete duplicates or make corrections, but it would be nice to not have to fix things, either.But overall it works well and has helped me several times when I am in the kitchen with my Echo Dot & my phone isn't available. It's great to have this option for what was already a really useful app for my family."

""tell our groceries,"" while not a tongue twister, is quite a lot, especially if you want to add a few items.Try this for example:"" Alexa tell our groceries to add milk"""" Alexa tell our  groceries to add eggs"""" Alexa tell our  groceries to add cheese""Is there a way to change the invocation phrase????

I also wish you could add quantities for items (you can in the app) with voice.holding off on purchasing the pro version of the app until such time it's more consistent, but we're overall relatively happy with it."

It also is nice because my husband and I can see and add to the same list.I love being able to tell Alexa to ask our groceries to add an item to our list. The reason I gave four stars instead of five is because you have to invoke Alexa for every single item. I would like to rattle off a list of items instead of one at a time."

When we go to the store we use the app on my Android phone as we shop.  Because of the categories, our list shows up pretty much in the same order as the aisles in the store.  I paid for the app on my Android, but I use the free ad-supported version on my iPad.  I used to use Google Keep for my lists, but when Goggle switched to the new Google Assistant List mess, I looked around and found OurGroceries. It really works well with Alexa.  Recommended."
B01D4F1J0M,OurGroceries,Food & Drink,Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Needs a few tweaks,"Reviewed in the United States on September 12, 2018","A very good skill that has been incredibly helpful, and is probably the thing we use Alexa for most often. It can sometimes get confused when trying to add items to a list other than the default list.My main complaint is when adding an item that is already on the list, it just increases the quantity of that item instead of warning you the item is already listed, and asking you to confirm that you‚Äôd still like to add it. Asking Alexa to remove the duplicate item does not reduce the quantity, and instead removes the item completely. This is frustrating."

B01D4F1J0M,OurGroceries,Food & Drink,Texas2Step,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love that services I currently use are available with Alexa,"Reviewed in the United States on December 20, 2018",We have utilized the OurGroceries app for years - so excited that it is integrated with Alexa.  Works perfectly - the added convenience of just verbalizing the addition to a list ensures that it will eventually get taken care of - today we are depended on one of us physically typing it in the app.  Added an example of how we have different lists set-up in the OurGroceries app - happy organizing!!
B01D4F1J0M,OurGroceries,Food & Drink,Texas2Step,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very handy,"Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2018",The best part about this skill is that it allows you to share grocery lists across accounts. The built-in Echo shopping list is limited to only the account of the person logged in at the moment. Our Groceries lets us call out to Alexa any time we run out of something and then both myself and my wife can go shopping any time with a synced list. It's particularly useful in that it's live so we can split up in the store and see items disappear as you both put them in the cart. The only hassle is that it's a bit too easy to accidentally check off items.
B01D4F1J0M,OurGroceries,Food & Drink,Mark Towler,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great, easy to use","Reviewed in the United States on September 6, 2018","Minus one star for bugging me to write a review; there's no way to say, ""Maybe later"" or ""No, thanks."" HOWEVER...I've used Our Groceries for Android for a while now, and was happy to find there was also an Alexa skill. It's very simple to use, and convenient to add stuff to my lists while looking in the fridge or pantry.A couple of additional features I'd like are: 1) the ability to add more than one item at once, and 2) add multiples of the same item at the same time. It would also be super cool if, when I ask Alexa to add an item that's already on my list, it would say so and ask if I wanted to add another before actually adding it.Thanks for making this!"

B01D4F1J0M,OurGroceries,Food & Drink,Laura M.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this Grocery List!,"Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2018","Our family has used this grocery list app for years. It is great to share the list among the family members so any of us can pick up from the list while we're out and also clear the item.  Lists can be associated with a person (like Jane's list)or a store (like Kroger or Costco).  I love that I can now tell Alexa to add to the list while cooking or perusing the refrigerator, it really saves time. I only wish I could add multiple items without asking Alexa each time."

B01D4F1J0M,OurGroceries,Food & Drink,morecowbell,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great App,"Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2022","OurGroceries is one of our most-used apps. You must remember to say ""Alexa, ask OurGroceries to add .... to the grocery list."" And it's not OurGroceries fault you can't just say ""Add .... to the grocery list."" It is the way Alexa is programmed. We like the way that it can be used by two people sharing a list in a store and if one buys something on the list and removes it, that item is also removed from the other person's list. This app has worked flawlessly for us. Kudos to the developer!"

B01D4F1J0M,OurGroceries,Food & Drink,DKVMorter,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works well,"Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2018",The skill works well with Alexa. I like it's easy to add back reoccurring items to the list without having to retype. Also it remembers your items and a quick tap increases/decreases quantity. The categories make it easy to organize your list to match the layout of the store.

I can't imagine why anyone would even try this app if they used Alexa lists and not OurGroceries.My family uses OurGroceries exclusively, and we don't have/use Alexa on many devices (mostly use google).

I group the groceries into categories to know what needs picked up where in the supermarket to stop the back and forths and i forgot that there so let me double back and waste my time to pick up even more eggs.

I tell Alexa (to tell our groceries) to add whatever I need, to whatever list I need it on and it‚Äôs all right there in my phone whenever I need it. The tricky part is getting others to use it, but that‚Äôs any shopping list that isn‚Äôt Christmas.Sometimes Alexa doesn‚Äôt always hear things correctly, so we‚Äôve gotten some things on the wrong list, easy enough to fix in app, or by restating with stronger enunciation. And sometimes we get phonetic or close to items on our list, but we‚Äôve always been able to puzzle it out.We share this app in our house so I can tell Alexa to add something and it‚Äôll show up on my spouses phone at the store."

Alexa/Our Groceries remembers what aisle my items are in after putting them in the correct aisle the first time.  That way we only go down aisle we need and minimize not buying items that aren't already on our list.We use it for favorite recipes importing from our favorite sites and also create a menu for the week so we only have to shop once a week (most of the time).

I also love how we can categorize different groceries so they appear in the order I‚Äôd run into them at the store.I have one feature request: could there be a place to add the item‚Äôs cost so the app could give me a rough idea of what I will be spending?

B01D4F1J0M,OurGroceries,Food & Drink,SunshineTrippedSoftly,5.0 out of 5 stars,Not for Alexa,"Reviewed in the United States on April 22, 2016","Our Groceries is a great app but using Alexa to add items is not good. If you use the Our Groceries master list and set it up to reflect your grocery store layout, you can walk through the store checking items off the list as you go. This functionality is the heart of the usefulness of Our Groceries.Alexa does not access the master list. Furthermore, Alexa creates a duplicate item with a store location of ""uncategorized "". You might as well just use any simple list app that you probably already have on your mobile device."

I especially appreciate the ability to add items to my list WHILE I am cooking or watching TV so that I don‚Äôt have to stop what I‚Äôm doing, find a pencil, and write it down.

Now when I tell Alexa ""Tell OurGroceries to add (whatever) to the shopping list"" she puts it in the app list.  You can also have multiple lists, tell Alexa to remove items from the list, and you can CATEGORIZE your items which the Alexa doesn't do and why I wanted it in the first place.  Now if I could have the categories come up in the order I specify rather than alphabetically (so I could arrange my list by my grocery store layout) this would be a five star app!"

B01D4F1J0M,OurGroceries,Food & Drink,Wayne,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works surprisingly well.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 31, 2021","Aside from the awkwardness of Amazon not allowing direct support of a third party shopping list, so I have to ask Alexa to ask OurGroceries, the options are clear and relatively instinctive. It's easy to add or delete items from any list. You can also add multiple items.I'm not good at remembering commands, so when I wanted to add multiple items to a list, I told Alexa to tell OurGroceries to add multiple items. I half expected to see ""multiple items"" appear as an item on my list, but OurGroceries surprised me and did exactly what I wanted.Far too many Alexa commands for third party use are counterintuitive, and this is the first time I've seen a third party add on get it completely right.I contacted Amazon separately to suggest that they allow third party shopping list support integrally, so I can simply say ""add [item] to shopping list"" and Amazon said that it's a great suggestion. So it wouldn't hurt if others ask for the same thing, to show that demand is there."

We bought the big box of K-cups at Sam's, fruit at Publix, canned goods at WalMart, etc. My wife always hated having to go to her iPhone to ""put things on the list"" for me.  Then--with only one list--I would go to each different store when I was there and have to sort through what we picked up there.Now--we can tell Alexia to ""tell our groceries to add strawberry yogurt to WalMart"" and instantly it populates the correct list. We are finding this extremely helpful.Very cool use of the technology."

I much prefer a dedicated shopping list app to the lists portion of the Alexa app.  However, I wish Alexa could learn that OurGroceries is my shopping list app of choice so I could simply say, ‚ÄúAlexa, add (item) to (store).‚Äù  While I‚Äôm wishing, it would also be nice if she could reply, ‚ÄúAnything else?,‚Äù to which I could respond, ‚Äúno,‚Äù or, for example, ‚Äúyes, eggs (pause) milk (pause) bread (pause) ice cream, etc.‚Äù  (The pause would eliminate confusion in the case of multiple-word items.).

Also, it won't work if you have the skill on one profile and Alexa is on the other. Ask Alexa to switch profiles and then try again. I've used Our Groceries for years and bring able to add items at the moment I realize I'm out is awesome. Because I usually forget by the time I want to write it down. It gets 5 stars because it still seems to miss and miss understand words frequently enough that it's annoying. Hopefully it's just because it needs time to learn my voice and speech patterns."

It can be linked to multiple devices so the whole family can see the list. I changed from another grocery app so that I could use it with Alexa. The other app was better.  It kept track of the amount spent and you could sort the list one way when preparing the list (like by category) and a different way when shopping ( like by aisle). This app only has a single sort. The interface is not very appealing either. It has all the items that I have purchased in a crossed out list at the bottom. I could delete them, but then I have to add back the aisle category every time I add it to the list. My other app stores the item in invisibly until I need it again. I also can't get Alexa to put in quantities. I have to manually change the quantity later, but at least it's on the list.  I love being able to tell Alexa to put items on the list while I'm in the kitchen cooking. That part is very handy."

My boyfriend and I use it to communicate what we need when I go to the store. We each have the app on our phones and enter things as we need them. I often forget to add something if I'm in the middle of cooking when I realize I need it. I love that I can just tell Alexa to add it for me. I use this ALL the time. I rarely even open the app on my phone anymore, except when I'm at the store. It is so convenient!Every once in a while, it doesn't understand what I'm saying if there's background noise. Other than that, I've had no problems with it. I don't forget things anymore!"

Having this app (and skill) allows me to categorize my items by section, such as produce, dairy, canned goods, etc. The built-in Alexa shopping list doesn't allow for that. If you don't do much grocery shopping, then the built-in shopping list is fine, but it was inadequate for my needs. I use Alexa all the time to add and remove items from my lists and it is super handy! I also have set up separate lists for groceries, Costco, and miscellaneous. OurGroceries is probably my most-used integrated app and skill with Alexa. Love it!"

The ability to sync multiple lists with multiple users in real time makes it the simplest way we have found to make shopping lists for all of our needs.  Remembered category/ aisles helps organize each store for quicker shopping trips.  Stored recipes are useful if you have common repeated recipes your family enjoys.With Alexa it is just that much easier.  Adding eggs to the list without having to stop and open the app is fantastic.(just watch out for when the kids get wise and start saying things like ""Alexa, ask Our Groceries to add candy bars to the Costco list"".)"

Something that I think should be made clearer in the description of the skill is that ""Shopping List"" as noted in the example commands means a list that already exists that you've named ""Shopping List"".  If you don't use ""Shopping List"", it can be whatever pre-existing list you've created in the app.Personally, I use OurGroceries for all of my lists (not just groceries), so I have a minor issue that's specific to my usage outside of Alexa - My primary ""Groceries"" shopping list is named ""A2-Groceries"" to ensure that it's near the top of my lists while keeping the rest alphabetical.  While I haven't tried asking the Alexa skill to add directly to that list, I have instead added a new list in the app called ""Shopping list"", which is specifically for Alexa added things so that I can say ""Alexa, ask OurGroceries to add cereal to shopping list"" as it's easier to remember."

It worked that way for over two years. Then suddenly it wouldn‚Äôt add anything to the Our Groceries Lists, just to the Alexa lists. After hours of fiddling with the thing, the fix was to say EXACTLY, ‚ÄúAlexa, ask our groceries to add *** to the shopping list.‚Äù It now must be said EXACTLY like that. Now it works great!  The instructions and help, of both Alexa and Our Groceries were about as clear as mud and were the most frustrating thing about both.

B01LYK4FI5,Sous Chef,Food & Drink,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Help Make This Skill Better,"Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2017","Full disclosure, I am the developer of this skill.  I don't like self reviewing but Amazon does not provide a way to respond to reviews.  I'm sure they're working on a better review system but until then I feel I have to go this route.I've been able to contact a couple of the current reviewers and help them with their issues.  If you have a problem with this skill please contact me for assistance, I'm happy to help.  You can do this by emailing help@souschef.recipes or by using the Sous Chef Recipes companion app, click on the accounts tab, click on the ‚Äúi‚Äù information icon and then click contact us.If you install the Sous Chef Recipes app on you phone you'll find that we've added a how to section with videos that walk you through how to use the app and how to connect to this skill.  We're working on more videos about how to interact with this skill so look for those in the near future.Now I'll justify my biased five star review.  Many skills so far are novel or entertaining however I think this skill is actually useful.  I use it almost daily.  I built it for myself and I could have kept it that way but I found it so handy that I felt I had to share.  None of the reviews actually speaks to working with the skill.  It's not perfect by any means but I'd hate to go back to cooking without it.I think that Amazon and developers are both trying to figure out this nascent technology.  Right now we're in the growing pains stage.  If you, as a cutting edge technology user help us learn along the way, the better the future will be for everyone.  In five years we'll all wonder how we ever got along without our digital assistants."
B01LYK4FI5,Sous Chef,Food & Drink,Bryan,4.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic App for Show Echos,"Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2020","This app does what we really wanted, to have OUR recipes easily accessible in the kitchen. Voice controlled and easy to import. You can use a website, photo or text to import, which really gives us the flexibility to bring all of our recipes in one place. We use MS OneNote to store them, but showing them in the kitchen is problematic, so this is the bridge. I'll happily spend $0.99/year for this privilege. Why 4 stars? We would like the ability to organize into categories (Chicken, Grill, Desserts, etc) and the ability to alphabetize seems linked to the time of import. I can't seem to figure out how a few remain un-alphabetized. Also a web interface would VASTLY improve importing as it can be difficult on a mobile device."
B01LYK4FI5,Sous Chef,Food & Drink,Just Theo,1.0 out of 5 stars,Needs a lot of work to be an Alexa skill,"Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2020","I recently tested this out to see if it could replace mypepperplate for me now that mypepperplate is going to a paid platform and it doesn't have Alexa capabilities. Well, I just tried to use it on my Echo Show and it's awful. When I open the skill, it automatically opens to the last recipe. There is no way to view all recipes on the show and select on. And I tried using voice commands to open my recipe. Alexa wanted to know the exact name, I tried several shortened versions of the same recipe and it would only pull it up if I named the entire recipe. I have hundreds of recipes that I could put in, but I don't want to try to remember them all. It would be easier if I could just scan through my recipe list and adding a picture to my recipe would be nice.As others have complained, you have the ability to see either the ingredients list or the steps, not both side by side. So I am constantly flipping between the two... step 1, add tumeric, go to ingredients to see how much tumeric, back to steps, back to list..... ugh. I can use my voice and ask how much tumeric, and Alexa will answer, but she also opens the screen for that single ingredient and I have to ask her to go back to the steps, to which she starts reciting them again and I have to stop that and then look for the next step.As others have said, you have to type a recipe in, one ingredient at a time and one step at a time. 10 years ago, pepperplate had the ability to just import a recipe from a website or let you copy and paste entire paragraphs and it would sort it out for you. I could copy an entire list of ingredients from a word doc and then paste it in pepperplate and it would sort the ingredients up as individual ingredients for me (there were some glitches and I had to check to make sure they were all there, but 95% of the time it worked). Same with steps, I could copy all steps and it would separate them for me. 10 years later, I expect this as a standard with any future apps or sites.I am disabling this skill for now and wouldn't recommend it. I might try it again in 5 years."
B01LYK4FI5,Sous Chef,Food & Drink,Joleen,4.0 out of 5 stars,"As Far As Apps Go, I Usually Think They're Pointless And Going Nowhere Fast.... But THIS Is A GEM of a Beginning!","Reviewed in the United States on April 4, 2018","Those Beginning Ideas That Are Already Great Or Only Need Minimal Tweaking In The Future: 1) I can enter my recipes, I can share recipes with other people I know using this app, and I can link to recipe websites through the app. 2) I appreciate the time-savers... to add things from my menu item recipe's ingredient list to my shopping list as I peruse them, and being able to scale recipes up or down! 3) The recipe input methods initially bothered me and took some adjustments.  The camera to simply take pictures, isn't as easy as you would think, but it IS still in beta testing.  I WISH it could have a way to input the recipes on the computer, on a nice big screen you can see, and a keypad that isn't blocking the view of where and what you're typing.  I just bought a blue-tooth keyboard for my phone as a compromise. Hand typing entire recipes into my phone under those conditions was a deal-breaker, so I found a way to live with it.  What I hope to see in the near future: 1) I'd like to add pictures of my creations to the recipes I input, saves a lot of description space and keeps the end presentation of foods right (can't have a plate full of mushy looking white foods, for example). 2) I'd like Echo Show to be able to show me what I see on screen in the app... ingredients list, steps list, notes, etc.  Alexa shows me nothing... meaning I can't use her... I have to use my phone app, which defeats MY purpose in the kitchen. I refuse to touch anything but the foods when I cook, so this is possibly going to be a deal breaker. 3) I'd like to be able to link recipes together for planned meals as well.  For example:  I make some meals that everything served for that meal is ALWAYS the same because it is perfection when put together.  I would like to tie entire menus together, if at all possible.  I'm just a farm wife that cooks for a lot of hired hands and/or other large groups, but this app shows some true potential for an app I would pay well for, and I bet other farm/ranch wives and/or caterers would as well!"
B01LYK4FI5,Sous Chef,Food & Drink,Snia,2.0 out of 5 stars,Best we‚Äôve got but needs a lot of work for Echo show,"Reviewed in the United States on January 1, 2020","I was looking for a skill that would let me pull up my own written recipes or recipes I find on random websites up on my echo show and this seems to be the only skill to do this. Unfortunately, the skill on thr Show forces you use voice commands to pull up recipes rather than having an option to click them. It often mishears what you say. Also once you get a recipe up it puts echo into a mode to receive a new command, so unless you click off or are very silent it interpreta anything you utter as a command to give you step by step instructions on the recipe. Never have I wanted to see only one line of a recipe. Also, once it goes into this mode theres no back command or button to get back to the full recipe so you have to ask for the recipe again. All voice command which is horrible. Makes for a very frustrating experience. But again its all we have. Please stop making everything go through voice and allow for touch commands as well."
B01LYK4FI5,Sous Chef,Food & Drink,Alyssa D,4.0 out of 5 stars,I love this skill!,"Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2018","I've been meaning to try out this skill since getting my Echo and I finally did tonight. Sometimes Alexa doesn't correctly hear me so I have to repeat myself. The list of ingredients and steps is read out quickly so I found myself needing to tell Alexa to stop after a few, get the ingredients, and then ask her to say the ingredients again to hear the rest (The ingredients are listed from the beginning every time). Other than those things, I really enjoyed cooking while asking Alexa what to do next.Inputting recipes felt simple and easy enough for me. I like that you can highlight the portion of text on a webpage that is the name, ingredients, and steps. No need to manually write everything down, or even copy and paste!Did you know you can meal plan with the app too? I just found that out. Can you set up recipes in advance and then ask what is for dinner today? Or something like that? That would be a nice addition."
B01LYK4FI5,Sous Chef,Food & Drink,J. Woolverton,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works as described.  Needs more for Echo Show,"Reviewed in the United States on February 7, 2018",The skill works just as described. However with the Echo Show I would expect more visual options. It will show me the ingredients but they go away after a few seconds.  Not sure if the skill developer can even fix that but that's my only complaint so far.
B01LYK4FI5,Sous Chef,Food & Drink,Jon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Too tedious,"Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2017",Many of the recipes I use are either a culmination of other recipes or recipes I've created.This app could move from 1 star to 4 or 5 stars if it had a way to enter recipes from a computer application or via a website.This is very tedious to enter a recipe if it's not exactly from one of the accepted websites.

B01LYK4FI5,Sous Chef,Food & Drink,B C J,4.0 out of 5 stars,Only App I've Found For Personal Recipes. Definitely Recommend!,"Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2020","Just started using this app and so far I'm impressed.  I haven't been able to find any other recipe app that will work with my recipes and echo show.  I've read a couple of other reviews stating you can't see all the recipes or Ingredients side-by-side with steps.  I have attached photos show that it is possible.  Could be that the developer added this feature after that review.  I am using the app on a Fire tablet 10 under the 'show' mode.  This could also explain the difference.This app is definitely a work-in-progress so no 5-star.  I would recommend going to website and view the help videos.  This explained how to use the app.Pros:Can use my own recipes and have echo show display them hands-free.Only app I could find that would work this way.Can import from website, text or camera.Cons:Importing from website is only on iphone app. (edit:works on fire tablet but not their website.)You need to cleanup the text or the program will not recognize the incredients (e.g. no bullets before ingredients).Not very intuitive.Create account on phone app or website before linking Alexa skill.Great app so far and thumbs up to developer.  Keep up the good work."
B01LYK4FI5,Sous Chef,Food & Drink,Susan Slazas,4.0 out of 5 stars,I like where this is going - but needs more work,"Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2019","So far, it's the only app where i can insert and view MY OWN recipes.A simple fix to start:On my 2nd gen Echo Show, all it shows is one giant list.  There's no separation between ingredients and steps.  How about separating them?Would be great to have alexa read it...but not a deal breaker.Inserting your own recipes could be easier (import function?) , but I'll take this over not having anything at all.Layout on the echo show could be nicer too.  Maybe just having better/larger separations between each ingredient/step would be nice.  Or maybe color/shade alternating steps?  Plus, as i mentioned above, having separate sections for the ingredients and steps would break it up better.But again, just happy to have something over nothing.  Text size is good!"

The app itself is great - pulling recipes over from websites like Epicurious and Food Network couldn't be easier. Once the recipe is loaded, it's great to be able to ask Alexa to read me the next step in the recipe or ask how much of an ingredient I need to use. I like to experiment with new recipes and this app allows me to do so without making a mess of my phone to check the cooking instructions. Great app/skill! Super fun and easy to use"

Basically you can use the phone app to copy a recipe into Sous Chef then ask Alexa to display it while you cook.

B071GCFSJ6,MEATER,Food & Drink,J. Stanley,5.0 out of 5 stars,These Reviews Are For The Alexa Skill!,"Reviewed in the United States on March 29, 2020","Not sure what these negative reviews are all about being that the intent is to review the skill here.  To begin, the skill is great and works exactly as designed...and it is dynamic to wht you are cooking! Ask the temperature and it tells you the internal and external temps...in either Celsius or Fahrenheit, depending on whst you chose in the MEATER app. This skill works perfectly and I have asked it multiple questions with 100% accuracy.  #1 Rule...read the instructions before using something new!Second, since others have decided to trash the product unfairly her for some reason, let me dispell some falsehoods seen in other ‚Äúreviews‚Äù and help those that are new to the MEATER product.- One, remove the plastic piece from the battery compartment on the bottom of the block/case the probe is in.  This will allow the battery to charge the probe.- Two, you MUST let the probe charge for at least four hours like the instructions tell you before pairing the probe to your smarphone or tablet.  There is a monitor in the probe that ensures the 4 hour inital charge is completed.  I promise, you wait and it will connect with no issue.- Three, make sure you set the temperature settings to Celsius or Fahrenheit.  That is how it will show message temps in Alexa.- Four, when you first successfully pair your probe you will then be given the opportunity to create your new account.  After this is successful and you are complete in the setup process within the app, then and only then can you enable the Alexa skill.- Five, the online support wizard is excellent. This will intuitively walk you through to find the answer to your question.  If you still need help, simply select No at the bottom that it did not resolve your problem.  It will then take you to an contact us form to submit to support.  They will then contact you...and quickly!I have used many types of temp probes over the years and this by far is the best and most intuative ever. Love this product and you will too.  Just follow the instructions."

Make sure if you imported a recipe from another website that you change the Source to ""Recipe Keeper"" afterwards or it won't show up on the Echo Show.Also, asking Alexa for your recipes requires you to know the exact keyword (can be the Name, Course, Category, or Collection). For example, I have a German Gl√ºhwein recipe, which is tagged with Course: Beverage and Category: Alcoholic. When I ask Alexa to pull up it by name, she didn't understand, nor did she understand when I said ""show me alcoholic beverages."" Only when I said ""show me alcoholic recipes"" did she successfully pull up the recipe.So yeah it just takes a bit of getting used to. Could be improved to be more intuitive/intelligent, but maybe one day..."

Losing one star at the moment because its not as smooth as it could be e.g. you have to exit the app between looking at recipes otherwise she doesn't recognize the next one.  I'm using my kindle fire tablet in 'show' mode.  I ask Alexa 'Ask recipe keeper for cheese recipes' and she says she has 17 recipes (from my recipe collection) and you see them listed, and can scroll thru.  Then either ask her for recipe by number (she doesnt recognise by name) or just pick it on screen.  If you want another recipe, you must exit (Alexa, exit) and give her about 30 seconds.  Then start again with 'Alexa ask recipe keeper for..)  So she is a bit clumsy at the moment, but its a good start.  Now ive got to figure out how to keep kindle from going to sleep lol."

If I ask it to open french dip sandwiches recipe. It cannot do that. However if I say open slow cooker recipes then scroll to recipe 47 I can then select it. cannot start a timer from within the app. You must exit the app start the timer and then go back into the app and find the recipe again. what I ended up doing was renamed in my kitchen device Alexa, and my living room device computer so I can yell to the living room to start the timer while using the one in the kitchen."
B08P3B9ZCR,Recipe Keeper,Food & Drink,Wes ,4.0 out of 5 stars,Could be the best recipe app out there. Almost is!,"Reviewed in the United States on February 28, 2022","Start off I didn‚Äôt hesitate to pay for the pro version here‚Äôs why.Looking to digitally store your own recipes for instant access while your shopping or simply wanting to make a shopping list from those recipes?Wanting a quick way to find your recipe, to follow while your cooking?Hands down the best app I‚Äôve tried to date. I‚Äôve tried many.Easy to automatically scan in a recipe from a recipe card, magazine etc. by using your phones camera.  You can  automatically upload from a recipe you found website .The app is Easy to navigate as well. I‚Äôm sure the developer spent a ton of time on this app.The 1 bad and definitely needs work thingEcho show integrationI wanted to find not just a great iPhone app but I wanted to use my echo show in my kitchen for recipes. Echo has a Nice big screen to follow while you cook. It just makes sense to keep it in your kitchen for cooking.It seems like it does kinda work but the developers didn‚Äôt quite finish the job.I have figured out how to finally see my recipes show up on the echo show. But it will take some playing around with.First offSynchronizing the phone app with a list of recipes that I had entered, to the echo show wasn‚Äôt that difficult.Especially when following the help guide located in the apps settings area.Once that‚Äôs done you will see some recipes on the Echo but maybe not your recipes. For instance the example recipes that came with the app. To fix this issue. You need to go into every one of your recipes u entered and the first page of the recipe file you need to change the source field to..‚Äùrecipe keeper‚Äù Leave out the quotation marks of course.A few minutes later you will see your recipes Show up. However they won‚Äôt just show up on the echo show Without perfectly asking the Echo show for the exact recipe that you were looking for. For instance ‚Äú Alexa ask recipe keeper  Brandie‚Äôs barbecue‚ÄùWhich can be difficult sometimes.  When you don‚Äôt remember the title of the recipe exactly.So I found a way to get the echo show to show all my recipes. With some trial and error I found that if you say this correctly, you will see all of your recipes show up.‚ÄúAlexa.  Ask recipe keeper.  Show all recipes ‚ÄúFrom there I can scroll through and pick the one I want to see.However there is one more issue I‚Äôm working through which I think I can eventually figure out.Out of my 30 some recipes I have added, it‚Äôs only showing 15 of them on the echo show. I have triple checked to make sure I properly entered ‚Äúrecipe keeper‚Äù in the source field.I‚Äôm kind of wondering now if the photo I used for that recipe may be too big in size.  I‚Äôll keep trying to troubleshoot this problem.Anyways great phone app for holding your recipes.I really hope the app developers improve upon the Echo show portion of this app.If they perfected it like they did the phone app. I can‚Äôt see why they couldn‚Äôt mass-market this and make it the most Widely used recipe app out there."

Also, no way to scale the recipe in the app and numerous other issues. I have found another app that seems to works well. I just have to copy and paste my recipes into it."

B078H2HJR7,Youchef,Food & Drink,Josh Schulz,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works well, have to spend some time to learn it","Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2018","Short version:  It takes a little work up front but does a great job of freeing up your hands.Long Version: This is exactly what I wanted in a cooking skill.  You go to the website, put the steps in, and then ask alexa for each step in order (you can go backward and forward).  When I cook my hands are messy and I tend to forget the order of things and how much.  This makes it really simple to find out what to do next without having to wash my hands and open my phone.A couple of things that will help you when you use it:1. Break each step into it's smallest possible unit ""Add 1 cup flour"", ""add 1tsp salt"", etc.  Then when you get them read back to you its one simple thing and you're not trying to parse a long instruction.2. Voice search on your recipes is possible and works fairly well: you don't need the code.3. After ten seconds or so it boots you out of the skill, instead of going back into it use the ""ask"" syntax: ""Alexa ask youchef to repeat"", ""Alexa ask youchef next"".  It's not natural but once you get a handle on it it's pretty easy, it makes timers easier to manage while you're cooking (you can't set them or check on them in the app).I don't use the ingredient feature much:  If you mention an ingredient in a step you can ask how much and it will tell you.  When I played around it seemed to work well but it was simpler for me to put the amount in each step.All in all a great tool in the kitchen and worth your small time investment."

Not only is there no way to see or edit your meals in the Alexa app, but you can only see them one at a time on the Echo Show, by specifically asking by day.And once I finally got the hang of adding meals for different days, I noticed I could not add a meal plan for Friday to save my life. Alexa had no trouble with the other days of the week, but when I said Friday, it would either give the ""Sorry, I'm having trouble connecting to your Meal Planner skill"" error or change it for today's meal.Note: I don't have a strong accent and I make sure to enunciate extremely clearly when I speak to Alexa."
B01J8UMJ5G,Meal Planner,Food & Drink,Jamie,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great start, limited on days.","Reviewed in the United States on November 2, 2016","Great idea for a skill.

Pretty basic.  Funny.  I'm not sure if this was supposed to be serious or not.  When I asked it to tell me more about a chicken Greek salad, it basically told me what it was.  No recipe.  I'm disabling it simply because I don't know why I would use it.  20 questions for something to eat might be acceptable, but 3?  Unless it's supposed to be humorous.  Then it was.

I think it could be great if it had more recipes but I understand that it is still under construction and a lot of recipes are submitted by users so as it grows this will improve rapidly.  It is very easy to add your recipe and also to add recipes you want to try from websites.  I added a few keto and paleo friendly recipes to try it out.  You will have to spend a few minutes tweaking the ingredients from website but this isn't too difficult.  Also a lot of the recipes I added don't have nutritional info because a lot of the ingredients I use were not available in their database.  Two additions I think would make it outstanding would be to have a shopping list available from the ingredients list and I would like to be able to pause the recipe as I am preparing it so I can follow it step-by-step.  Otherwise it's just easier to go to the website and click the link to get the recipe.

I want to have access to such a list when I'm at the grocery store to see what I have on hand so I purchase accordingly.  I'd like a list of what I've stored in my freezer that looks like the shopping list that can be developed with Echo. Listening in my kitchen -- which is where we keep our Echo -- to Alexa verbally run through all the stuff in my freezer would take an eternity.  And that's not where I most need the info. Afterall, there I can just open the freezer and look.  Again, I want access to the info at the grocery store.  Ideally, the list would sort alphabetically by food item and numerically by freezer date, so it's clear what I have and what's fresh and what's not.  I really hope that this issue gets resolved or that an innovator is inspired to develop a skill that includes this feature.  I'd pay for it."
B01MSK0GFN,Glad Leftovers,Food & Drink,Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Needs some human/machine interface work, but it functions","Reviewed in the United States on April 25, 2017","Unlike some of the other reviewers, I haven't had any issue at all removing items. In fact, that now seems to be the default setting. When adding an item, if the Echo got it wrong and I said no, it immediately assumed I wanted to delete something. On the plus side, asking it to delete something was really easy and it worked. On the negative side, if I said I wanted to add something, I'd be asked, ""What do you want to add?"" If I just said the name of the product, it would switch gears and ask me if I wanted to delete the item. ONLY by following up the question by prefacing my food item with the word ""Add"" again, would she keep out of the delete loop. I really only got this skill so that I wouldn't have to go open everything in the kitchen to figure out what I wanted to eat... I like the idea of Alexa just telling me what's in there so I can decide while I'm doing something else that doesn't involve pawing through an open fridge. This allllllmost gets me there. Not loving the 3 item repeat limit, especially for that purpose.Not loving the attitude this skill makes my Echo throw when I quit, either. ""Fine - leave me..."" What the crap, Glad? Don't hijack my Alexa's default ""personality""... that's jarring and kind of rude. If I want my Echo to throw shade I'll go enable one of the insult skills. It's extra not cute when the skill set is still kind of spotty."

""I think I heard add chicken to the fridge, is that right?"" ""Yes"" ""OK, added chicken to the fridge.  Do you want to add or remove anything else?""

Fish, well time is somewhat important but not to where an extra 15-20 minutes cooking will just ruin it. No, temperature in relation to desired doneness (well, medium, rare) is what sous vide cooking requires. 2-5 degrees can make the difference between just ok and delicious.

The one big thing it lacks is ""live"" status updates. I don't want to just know when the pizza's here -- the knock on my door tells me that. I'd like to hear that my order's being put in the oven, that it's on its way, that the driver is a few minutes away. The location near me sometimes gets INSANELY busy, and it'd be nice to have Alexa tell me when it's moving along rather than having to keep poking the app to see what's going on with my pizza.Setup and linking instructions were also a little unclear, which might make it needlessly difficult for some, but I was able to figure it out without too much hassle. Would be nice to see this process made a little simpler somehow."

To get the update of my order I have to ask Alexa to ask Dominos every time and then wait for her to ask me what phone number I used... then wait a little longer and finally the update..... but I already got the answer on my phone 2 seconds after I picked up my phone. It would be nice if Alexa could just speak the updates as they occur rather than my having to ask all the time and keep reciting the phonebook in a crowded room...

I don't always order the same thing every time, but there is a certain order I consider my ""favorite."" I have that set as my Easy Order. When I'm home and the wife isn't, I just shout to the void, ""Alexa, tell Dominos to place my Easy Order."" Then, like magic, pizza arrives at my doorstep about 20-30min later. If, for some reason, pizza has not arrived within 20min or so... I once again shout into the void, ""Alexa, ask Dominos where my pizza is."" Then the void answers back, ""It's out for delivery."" Magic. Seriously, the future is now.In seriousness, I almost gave 4 stars instead of 5 because of that limitation. It can only repeat your last order, or place your Easy Order. I can't think of a viable solution for ordering something more complicated, though. By the time Alexa walked you through which coupons, pizza, crust, and toppings you want... it would probably have been easier just to grab your phone or laptop. Maybe. What do I know. I look forward to the time when I can find out for myself."

She asked if we wanted to repeat our last order, and since we‚Äôre pretty predictable when it comes to pizza, it was super easy. However, not being able to use a coupon made the order nearly $12 more expensive and I had to call the store to ask them to apply the coupon. So much for saying us a step. Further, when talking to Alexa, there was no mention of a payment method at all, leaving us wondering if the order had been paid for with the payment method stored in our account. Turns out, it wasn‚Äôt paid for and we needed cash at the door, which luckily we were able to scrounge up."

Setup an account. Place my first order. When checking out the first time, save that order as my easy order. The first order you can track by asking alexa to open domino's and select track order. The second time you order, you can select the easy order that you created the first time. If you want a special order, it is way faster to do it with the app and would be so convoluted trying to use voice selecting pepperoni yes, olive no, etc. I think the only thing that would make this better would be to be able to add a promotion coupon. Or for Alexa to say get 50% off entire order today, would you like to apply it."

I have no idea why it started working, but I can now order pizza through Alexa. I didn't make any changes, just decided to try it again and it worked. It works rather well now, and you can even ask Alexa what is in the order incase you forget what it was, as well as ask where your order is...as the pizza guy can never find my house and so I have to wait outside for him. I would love to be able to set up multiple orders for different occasions. Just being able to ask for orders by a preset list created on their website would be nice. I rarely order the same thing twice in a row, so it would be nice to have some variety.(Original Post - 1star)Says I have an invalid payment method. No noticeable way to correct what works fine for paying when using any other way of buying Domino's Pizza. so until they fix it, this is a waste.(Update below-11-4-2016 - one star)I have attempted to use Alexa again to order Pizza. I redid the entire account on both Alexa and on Domino's. From there website with all the same info I can order without any issues, but from Alexa I still get a generic ""invalid Payment Error"". It doesn't explain what is wrong with my account, and calling customer service from Dominoes, they couldn't see anything wrong either.Now, payment issue aside, Alexa hears the commands without issue and attempts to order my pre-saved order that I set on Dominoes Website, but I guess I've got to get off the couch and login to the computer and order the pizza the not so old-fashion way. Will try again the next time I see an update for the app."

All in all, a pretty seamless process, but definitely room for improvement."

B01FPZD966,Chef Basil,Food & Drink,TJ McLoughlin,3.0 out of 5 stars,Inspiring app.,"Reviewed in the United States on June 15, 2016","When I cook I like to check out some recipes to get some ideas. I usually don't have all the ingredients and most likely won't go to the store to buy a shallot when I already have an onion on hand. That being said, I checked out Chef Basil and searched for some basic recipes just to see what would turn up, (no turnip recipes though). Wait... On second thought, I just searched turnip, and it did offer me a few including a Turnip Fries recipe, which sounded yummy. The search almost always had 3 recipes for me to choose from. For example if you search meatloaf, it will say we found 3 recipes, meatloaf, meatloaf. & meatloaf. Umm, Alexa I'll try the meatloaf. Sometimes the recipe just has ingredients, and to be honest that's ok with me as I usually wing it anyhow. I just need to be inspired, and Chef Basil did inspire me! There are definitely some things that need to be worked out, and I wouldn't mind a reverse recipe look up feature where you give some ingredients that you have and Alexa says 'Dude, you can make a quiche!""  That would be cool."
B01FPZD966,Chef Basil,Food & Drink,Grant H.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Early stage prototype,"Reviewed in the United States on June 6, 2016","Chef Basil represents an interesting concept, but it is definitely still a prototype in its early stages of development. For instance, when you open the app, you can search for a recipe, but when you open that recipe, sometimes there are no steps. It also experiences errors relatively frequently (Chef Basil is acting up right now, please try again in a little while).Most importantly, there doesn't seem to be a way for it to track where you were in the recipe once you exit (at least I haven't been able to figure it out). For recipes, which usually have multiple steps, this is a major problem."
