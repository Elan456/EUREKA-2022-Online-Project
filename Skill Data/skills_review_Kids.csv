B07C53XY9P,RoosterMoney,Kids,Michelle MacDowell,4.0 out of 5 stars,Needs work but so much potential,"Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2020","I’m being a little generous here with the stars because I think this app has amazing potential. As of now, the only thing they can do effectively is tell my children how much money they have spent and earned.A big reason we got the app is so that Alexa could give them a verbal rundown of the chores they have scheduled for that day.i’m optimistic and hopeful that the app developers will be able to add or improve that feature.note: it’s possible that this is purely an operator error issue on our end. ￼￼"

B078LL5ZL3,Animal Rescue,Kids,Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Appropriate game play for elementary school ages. Allows player to name and raise a baby panda.,"Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2018","This fun, interactive game begins by introducing you to the Panda Sanctuary in Wolong, and explains that as a volunteer you must help raise a baby panda to be released in the wild. Throughout the game, the single player proceeds through levels and earns points for correct answers that lead to a healthy and happy adult panda. The player is first introduced to a companion, Ivy, who is also a volunteer. Ivy appears repeatedly to deliver advice, facts, or to help game play.The player starts with a newborn and gets to choose whether it is male or female, and then gets to name the panda. Correct answers and decisions result in the panda learning a crucial life skill. After completing each level, the player chooses whether to continue or come back tomorrow. After 9 levels of play, the baby panda has fully grown and has all of the skills it needs to be released into the wild.If the player doesn't answer the questions correctly, a Sanctuary Officer appears and gives a three-question quiz. We encountered a bit of a glitch during this section as the questions repeated, but the ""correct"" answers differed in two turns. Not answering the questions correctly leads to the Sanctuary Officer giving you one caution. Three cautions will cost you the game.Instant feedback on answers is given with a combination of a tone and verbal acknowledgement. Point totals are given after each question, as well as at the completion of each level. Remediation isn't consistent, but when offered, is in the form of a hint rather than explicitly giving the right answer.  Playing the game all the way through takes around 45 minutes, so for smaller children this might be better broken into a daily game time."
B078LL5ZL3,Animal Rescue,Kids,DL,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love it - great immersive experience, well written & performed","Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2021","We love this skill.  My 6 year old uses it everyday to save the Panda, Turtle and Tiger.  It has engaging actors and sounds effects that make it seem ""real"".  The choice options are given simply so you don't run into the fuzzy language issues (so my kid isn't screaming ""the bamboo"" at Alexa 7 times when it wants ""bamboo plant."" like other skills we have issues with) It also has chapters so you can pause play.  AND it remember where you stopped so you can start it again later.  Very helpful when you have a kid who loves it but needs to do other things once and a while :DAlso - we never paid or were asked to pay for extra sessions - they were all there (Turtle, Panda, Tiger) once I enabled the skill.To the developers: you asked for suggestions for other animals - my son's request: cheetahs, elephants and whales"

I received a text from amazon to approve the purchase and did so.  The turtle rescue says it is still pending parent approval.  I have chatted with three customer service representatives and have enabled and disabled the skill on our Echo Dot, my phone and the computer.  I have unplugged our device and re-plugged it in to reset it.  Nothing works and I can't get those 2 HOURS I spent chatting to reps back.

But not glad to be kicked out when I need to talk to my kid. Or ask him to do something. A total pause would be AWESOME.  You could even end it with a please review or some such.Ivy baby talks.I would hate my toddler to be learning baby talk from something teaching them.And we Quickly found it annoying.My 10 yo started this game, we've been anxious for fun games on Alexa, and me the 12 yo joined in. Both of my sons found this game fun and cute.  And both would like more levels. So would I. this is adorable.I would love it if you would PLEASE give us multiple accounts?

Level 5 is as high as it goes, but there isn't any noticeable difference between any of the levels.

B07F7XC85X,Kids Word of the Day Flash Briefing,Kids,Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Still liking this skill... because the developers listened to feedback,"Reviewed in the United States on July 14, 2018","UPDATE:  I'm pleased to report the developers are listening to user feedback. It is easier to listen to and self-contained for listeners who may not tune in every single day.  We complained when we couldn't understand the hosts, and they cleared it up.  We complained when they removed the spelling, and they added it back in.  Kudos to Volley for trying to give users what they want.  My original review is belowA long-time listener to the grown-up WOTD version, I was quick to add the kids' version when it launched.  While at first I felt the show was just a bit long with the riddle and pun-filled characters, I soon realized that charm was just what kids need to activate their brains and get focused.  What really impressed me though is the mnemonic aids built in to the broadcast that will subtly assist them in remembering the word itself: repetition is obvious, but the use of a musical scale during the spelling portion to chunk large data and sequence it?  That's genius.  Now if I could just find a way to play just this briefing instead of the whole flash update when I want to share it with my classroom this fall, I'd be all set!"
B07F7XC85X,Kids Word of the Day Flash Briefing,Kids,Foster Mama,3.0 out of 5 stars,It WAS great,"Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2018","I used to enjoy their program but I believe they stopped their production. They kept repeating the same old episodes over and over, so I finally deleted them from my briefing.> Original Review <I love love love this flash briefing! I’m an adult and English is not my first language. I’ve been looking for English learning skills/flash briefings but I haven’t found anything that made me want to stick with. This one is short, fun and very useful.I took a star off because... 1. Please spell out the word. I believe it’s very important. 2. Although I love that you bring in special guests, many of them mumble and I don’t understand them. Because this show is for learning, I hope the guests could speak out a bit more clearly.With those improvements, this show can easily get 100 stars! Also, please consider developing a kids idiom of the day flash briefing. I think you can make another funny show. “Cold turkey? Whaaat??”"

Yay!,"Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2018","We listen to Kids Word of the Day each morning while waiting for the bus, so the information needs to be concise.  The developers must have listened to the bad reviews because lately we haven't had any ""guests"".  I was considering deleting this skill, but the current format is clear and efficient, even with the time used for the riddles. The riddles are not easy and I like listening to my children discuss their guesses and reasoning behind them."

Over the past several weeks guest hosts such as ""Bane,"" ""Snape,"" and ""Yoda"" have been bringing us words instead. This would be great, if they didn't sound like they were speaking thru a mouth full of marbles from the bottom of the ocean. Seriously, I can't understand more than 1 word in 3. Thankfully the host repeats most definitions in a clear tone, but  I was tired of the guests three weeks ago. Even the kids (5 thru 9) are frustrated now."

It also doesn't use any SFX, it's just Alexa's Voice. The skill also doesn't take advantage of the screen display either, remember use your real estate. It keeps track of overall score which means if you answer the same question right over and over you score goes up.  The skill needs a bigger database of questions to start with.

B07SQHDD99,Highlights Storybooks from Bamboo,Kids,PV,5.0 out of 5 stars,Educational and deeply engaging for kids,"Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2019","Since I do not have a television at home, it is sometimes difficult to keep kids engaged beyond a point (I run out of storytelling abilities after the first seven minutes or so). Last evening, my five-year-friend (neighbor) was visiting (her mother had some chores to deal with)—and after exhausting the Dr Seuss book, and a couple of stories, I turned on this new skill on impulse! It took the child a minute to get the hang of it—and she was totally engaged for the next half hour. Each passage had a bunch of questions—and the child sat there chatting patiently with ‘Alexa’—the first time in the evening she just sat in one place and answered questions instead of asking them! When her mother arrived, she was in the middle of the skeleton costume story—and the mother was a little surprised when her daughter announced: Mamma—you have 206 bones! Yup—I would highly recommend this skill. Edutainment? Is that what they call it?"

Sorenson,5.0 out of 5 stars,Who does not love Highlights?,"Reviewed in the United States on January 22, 2020",This is about the only way they could have made Highlights better--a little bit of nostalgia mixed with a quite a bit of modern tech and my kids (and I) are happy all through breakfast. This is such an easy win. The kids love to chat with Alexa and now she's asking them to play and remember and figure things out at just their level. I remember how happy I was when I knew the answer to Highlights problems--and now so do they.
B07SQHDD99,Highlights Storybooks from Bamboo,Kids,zakah123,1.0 out of 5 stars,DON’T WASTE YOUR TIME!,"Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2019",I tried this app because the most recent Highlights magazine advertised it as “NEW!

It doesn’t hear/understand any title you say - and that’s after listening to the list of books repeatedly because the title has to be exactly right but you only have the option to select after it finishes the list and instructions.

Immediate feedback provided.,"Reviewed in the United States on April 5, 2020","I was contacted by one of the apps founders for our school to be part of a trial. Our students are legally blind and we are trying it in our K-3 classes. Misha, the cofounder I have been working with, has been 100% supportive.  He trained me and our staff by webinar and communicates regularly with us. We are currently out of school in NY  due to the Corona Virus, but we will continua using it once we are back. In the meantime if students have an Alexa device at home, they can continue using it. Great for learning and practicing basic Math skills and new skills are  being added."

B07YG3BL1K,Thinking Cap Math,Kids,Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fun way to practice math facts,"Reviewed in the United States on March 18, 2020",I am a teacher and I used Thinking Cap Math in a small group pull out with two students who were learning 3rd grade math. The students thought the app was really funny.  I kept them engaged - so much so that they asked to do it every day!

We have them use it a couple of times a week and I really see how their math skills are improving. For example our daughter, just turned 7, now knows all the combinations of 7, 8, 9 and 10! I feel like the creators really put a lot of thought into how to present the material to a child. My favorite part is the math stories, which are seriously hilarious. And when my kids make mistakes, it never says ""Wrong answer!"", but just tries to lead them to a correct answer. I thought that was perfect. And even for our third grader it is a great way to recap the basics, like working on how to add numbers quickly, up to 20. Overall a great app. I'm on the PTO, so I have been telling everyone at school about this app!"

Everything from ""Log into Teams and get ready for your next class"" to ""Spanish is about to start. You got this."" But there was something missing. The good ol' school bell.Did a quick search yesterday and found this skill, with lackluster reviews. Don't knock it 'til you try it, I always say. So I installed this skill, made a quick test routine and worked flawlessly within a couple of minutes.Here's how:1. Install skill2. Create New Routine3. Choose Routine name4. When this happens / Schedule / At Time / Weekdays + Select the time you want the bell to play.5. Add Action / Custom / Alexa says:""ask school bell to ring"".6. Select the Alexa speaker that's gonna play the bells.7. Enjoy!*Nitpick, sounds like a fire station's bell, but it does the job. Hence the 4/5 stars."

B086VHXC96,School Bell,Kids,trench,1.0 out of 5 stars,Why does Alexa need to ask me if I scheduled her to do it?,"Reviewed in the United States on April 5, 2021","The bell is fine.  Sounds close enough to a school bell to work for our early morning homeschool routine.  However, I have it set as a scheduled routine in Alexa (every morning at 8:30am) and every Alexa still asks every morning ""would you like the ring the school bell?  Tell me to ring the school bell"" and repeats this until you say ""ring the bell"".  Why?  I wouldn't have scheduled it if I wasn't sure I needed it and I honestly can't imagine another purpose for this other than home/remote schooling.  Honestly, the Amazon Alexa developers could just put a school bell in the sound selection on Alexa and this 'skill' would be obsolete pretty quickly, but they haven't, so I have been using it.  I'll change my rating if the 3rd party dev who put this together updates before the end of the school year."

Maybe also a follow up listening for a response mode so I don't have to keep saying the entire phrase for every command. That by itself is so frustrating.

Also, when we are instructed on how to correctly spell the word, it goes so fast on to the next one, they’re not learning. Maybe ask person to spell again after they hear the correct spelling."

Still I would not have downgraded it for that.  This skill uses the standard voice, but very FAST, hard to understand and doesn't listen/comprehend well. It was extremely aggravating for the kids AND for the adults listening to them try to use it, as Alexa couldn't appropriately acknowledge correct spelling!

I had to keep guessing to move on to the next animal. She uses the word ""dot"" constantly. I believe it is so she will pause in between sentences, but it gets very annoying. If you get too specific, your answer will not count. For example, If you guess ""Polar Bear"" and the answer is ""bear"", the answer is counted as incorrect. But, the skill was very fun and challenging to play."

I noticed complaints about homophones but the words are actually said in the dialogue just prior, (which doesnt repeat)  so you just have to pay attention to context. i.e. if the character will say something like ""I am bored of this."""

It also is not ever clear which version of a word it is looking for, it would be cute if for words that are homonyms there was a little mini insult to create context. We have also had multiple occasions where we spell something correctly but our dialet is not understood, it is super discouraging for a 7 year-old who is actually a pretty good speller most of the time. Things I love as a parent, this keeps her busy and away from a screen, she is engaged, laughing and learning new words. It just needs some updating."

B07BC7G4JH,Red Riding Hood - Interactive story for kids,Kids,Robert DeLuca,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not for kids under the age of 5!,"Reviewed in the United States on January 26, 2020","Red Riding Hood is a story for children. But there is an ending that might upset them. The Big Bad Wolf dresses as Emilia’s/Red Riding Hood’s Grandma and lures Red Riding Hood OR Emilia into Grandma’s House. How to get the ending is to pick the choice: “Give Grandma the basket” and then the Big Bad Wolf Say’s “Mmmmmm! Cheese! Yummy, bread!” and Red Riding Hood says: “What is your third favorite Grandma?” and the Big Bad Wolf Says “LITTLE GIRLS!” and the Big Bad Wolf killed Red Riding Hood.

B07VYW5TRH,Ghostbusters: Franchise 84,Kids,Delibird,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bustin' Makes Me Feel Good (and so does this Skill)!,"Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2019","A fun skill that allows you to interact with a team of rookie ghostbusters, out to prove that they can bust ghosts with the best of them.  Like most Alexa skills, it's audio-dominated, but a screened device will display some visuals as well.It’s not necessary to be familiar with the movies in order to play this game, but fans of the GB franchise should get a kick out of hearing Dan Aykroyd as Ray Stantz and Ernie Hudson as Winston Zeddemore talking to them, plus other familiar references from the film that you’ll have to find out for yourself.This is an enjoyable skill with great replay value  -- if you play a ghost busting mission at the same location over again, you will likely get different encounters from the ones you got the first time.

It gets very hot here in the desert and this one keeps her entertained for hours until cool enough to go back outside again. Please, please, please add more!! Maybe even just one feature added to each location? A different animal calling in the kitchen, a fruit to pick off the farm?I did notice one bug. When she was asking for the peanut butter and jelly sandwich in the kitchen, it would think she said goodbye or stop or something. Even i'll say it and she'll think i'm saying bye? Also, we play restaurant and the dialog goes really fast, maybe slow it down or start by saying what they will need for each recipe? We will need 1 spoon, 1 cup, 1 cup of chocolate powder, and some marshmallows? Anyways, the bugs are by far worth it and for the fun and pretend! Thank you! She's a huge fan!"

I played it with my five year old and we had fun for a few games.Pro’s - graphics are very colorful, gameplay is simple but effective. Sounds that are incorporated are age appropriate.Con’s - Using the term “zoo time” constantly throws off the device as time is a reserved word and starts the timer, or states what time it is. Also swiping the screen once three animals are displayed stops the game - and then requires the game to be restarted."

Since this was made with kids in mind, it should definitely be multiple choice. Even adult games just like this are multi choice, never open-ended.

It works perfect! After each animal task it plays a bit of music for the kids to play during, after about 4 animals it asks if you wish to continue.On a Friday night with a rowdy 4yr old and 7yr old this was a good few minutes of fun and running around."

However, my one complaint is that it constantly asks them to say the animal noises or “more” for it to keep playing. This makes it hard when my two year old is playing alone and I’m not right in the room because then it will just shut off. I wish they could play this independently since I often turn it on when I’m trying to get cleaning done."

B077Y6XNK2,Animal Workout,Kids,Grace,5.0 out of 5 stars,Incredibly fun and helpful!,"Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2018",This is such a creative skill. It gives you a short and sweet description of the animal and it's characteristics and tells you how to use their features to exercise. She stops every few animals to ask if you want a break and doesn't cycle through the same ones so there's always something new and exciting. The music is lively and the workout duration is short enough to keep a child engaged but long enough to tire them out after a few animals. I highly recommend this skill.

They enjoy it and it helps get some of their energy out, especially on dreary days.  All the animals are great for kids, they haven't found one they don't know about yet.  They also provide some fun facts about the animal they are pretending to be so they are learning a  little bit as well.The only thing that would make it better is, I wish they would repeat a direction or give kids a little time before moving to the next activity. My boys are cheering when they finish an activity and don't hear the directions for the next one."

It asks you to repeat words or will ask you more or all done and sometimes it can't even understand me. Very frustrating. If it took out the requests to repeat back to it or just said good job no matter what the child says to it and continues the exercises then it would be a 5 star app to me."

Girlfriend was sleeping while I was at work. Yesterday as she was sleeping, this came on and said something similar to ""look behind you"" or ""I see you behind the bla bla"" (according to her) - she was sleeping right next to alexa. She texts me and said ""stop pranking me. That was not funny."" I was confused as heck. I know about remote activation but I did not do that for sure. I looked at the history and nothing was activated or voice controlled.No idea how alexa just starts doing random stuff like that but this app will probably scare the Bejesus out of you if you're not playing the game. Yes she was alone in the house at the time. No idea how Alexa started playing the game."

Multiple difficulties allow for winnable games for players of any skill level, and the game is flexible with the words you use to describe the position you want, rather than strictly enforcing its own.The only missing feature I can think of is allowing Alexa to play first. Currently, the human player gets the first move every time. It'd be nice to the player and Alexa alternating first-moves in successive games ala traditional tic tac toe."

Yes it could use clearer speaking. It also needs to slow down to allow children a chance to think about the answer in hide and seek. The call Elmo for the letter of the day is GREAT for my 3 yr old grandson. People complain about skill being stuck and cant move on to something else. There is a button in your app that says disable skill or speak ""alexa exit sesame street"" or ""alexa disable skill"". Works every time for us. But all in all my grandson wants to call Elmo every single day for the letter of the day and he repeats his sentence including letter of the day all day long. Great! 💖"

It is Elmo’s voice so you have to listen carefully because it’s like listening to a 3.5 year old (you know, cause that’s how old Elmo is!) we have to play with our little one because Alexa is not able to understand him (and sometimes she doesn’t really understand us either). Our LO doesn’t care that she sometimes doesn’t respond the way we asked.We enjoy jumping back and forth between the two games before moving on to a song request or two (or maybe one song on loop for an hour 😂)"

Elmo is pretty quiet compared to Alexa. It's easy enough to hear in a quiet environment. But if your household is anything like mine, then there is noise coming from people making dinner or kids yelling in the other room. Turning up the device would be the easiest solution but then Alexa is so loud that neighbors can hear her through the walls. Great concept, excellent gameplay but needs a bit of volume equalization."

B078RGPMY6,Lemonade Stand,Kids,Harri McNuggs,2.0 out of 5 stars,Definitely some issues.,"Reviewed in the United States on January 17, 2021","At first i loved this game, but the more you play it the more frustrating it is. The weather report will at times not matter. It can be hot with one cloud in the sky and you will only sell one cup of lemonade. The game randomly quits from timr to time, and one time wiped hundreds of dollars i had saved. It's given cups away for free when I've tried to sell them for a dollar (on many occasions).The concept is great. I do love simplicity yet slight randomness that the weather brings. Although, it needs work. This comes from an almost top 500 ranked player @ ~100 days, so I've put in the time before this review."

B078RGPMY6,Lemonade Stand,Kids,Rob Phillips,1.0 out of 5 stars,Frustration plus!,"Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2021","as the headline says, this game represents about as much frustration as you could get from an Alexa scale.Frustration is an understatement. The game will tell you that it’s sunny and very warm and yet you will sell no lemonade. And then it will have many days of cloudiness which is fine however if you’re driving along and trying to play this game it’s frustratingly slow and does not give you the phone you’re looking for which is to configure your lemonade stand and see how many cups you sell based on the weather.The background sound is also frustrating because the sounds don’t match any of the weather. You’ll hear kids playing the same no matter what the weather is it was just an unnecessary feature.Do you sound like little peeves, but try it and you will understand.￼"

But sometimes (Who am I kidding? Most of the time!) Alexa mishears and ruins our progress. This kind of ruins the game for us. Once I said $1 & 95 cents and Alexa gave out lemonade for free, and what was even more upsetting was we sold 6 cups, Another time, I said $1 & 75 cents and Alexa thought I said $1,000 (How do you even mistake that???) on a HOT DAY. I can’t. And the several reviews I tried to write? Amazon Alexa messed it all up. I wanted to give it 4 stars, then three stars, and now, I’m giving it two.

B07BJ4CHKH,Divine Office Magnificat,Kids,Nancy,1.0 out of 5 stars,Pray to God,"Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2019","Mary was a human being who was born, as all humans are, with a sin nature and who recognized that she needed a Savior. In fact, the very passage used in the Hail Mary, known as Mary’s Magnificat (Luke 1:46-55), contains the declaration “my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,” a clear indication that she understood her need for a Savior from sin.The Bible never says that Mary was anyone but an ordinary human whom God chose to use in an extraordinary way. Yes, Mary was a righteous woman and favored (graced) by God (Luke 1:27-28). At the same time, Mary was a sinful human being who needed Jesus Christ as her Savior, just like everyone else (Ecclesiastes 7:20; Romans 3:23; 6:23; 1 John 1:8).Prayer to anyone other than God alone is anti-biblical. Praying to Mary or petitioning her to pray for us is against the Scriptures. Prayer is an act of worship. When we pray to God, we are admitting that we need His help. Directing our prayers to anyone other than God is robbing God of the glory that is His alone, something God hates and will not tolerate (Isaiah 42:8).While Mary was certainly a godly young woman greatly blessed in that she was chosen to bear the Savior of the world, she was not in any way divine, nor was she sinless, nor is she to be worshipped, revered, venerated, or prayed to."

B073X5FYVF,Amazon Storytime,Kids,Michael Picagli,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good but lacks options,"Reviewed in the United States on June 20, 2018",My daughter and I enjoyed it but she was very sad that we could not play a story she heard previously. Even asking for it by title name didnt work. Nor could it comply by asking for it to play the last story we heard. It would also be a nice feature to be able to mark stories as “favorites” so we can hear them again.

My kiddos like to listen to the stories, even though in my opinion they arent frightfully interesting. I definitely think they should add more stories to it. But the reason I decided to share my review is because I have read several reviews that state they should make jf to where it turns off after awhile. you can achieve this by saying “alexa, stop playing in thirty minutes” or however long you choose! hope that helps :)"

He would listen to it for an hour at a time. However, the stories started repeating. Very few seem to be actual published books. The quality of the stories is poor. Lots of whining and even lying to adults in stories. The one where the boy and girl play pretend house is what got me to disable the skill. “Do you like my new yoga outfit, honey?” 🤢 Why have my kids listen to these crappy stories? Most characters display behaviors I wouldn’t want my kids to emulate."

B073X5FYVF,Amazon Storytime,Kids,Robert S.,1.0 out of 5 stars,horrible update!,"Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2021","There are two major issues with this update. First, my kids used to be able to open amazon storytime by themselves. Ever since this update, I now have go to each of my kids rooms and launch it. I have 4 kids. My wife is not even able to do it. Only me. That is unacceptable.Second, frequently, it will stop playing after one or two stories, which then makes me have to open it yet again for them.These two issues make this skill absolutely ridiculous, and a pain in the you know where to use. Only reason I still use it is because the Alexa voice telling the stories in the bedtime story skill is horrible and annoying. Has no emotion, and just drones on.Please fix ASAP."
B073X5FYVF,Amazon Storytime,Kids,Kevin,3.0 out of 5 stars,Needs a way to stop remotely or at a certain time,"Reviewed in the United States on December 18, 2018",This app is fantastic and my kids love it. They love it so much it keeps them awake until I go upstairs and shut it off... after more than an hour sometimes. This needs a timer of some sort or perhaps a custom story count (15 mins or so?) then turn it off.
B073X5FYVF,Amazon Storytime,Kids,Nellie Lewis,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon story time,"Reviewed in the United States on April 5, 2018","I love this skill because it has many funny, sad, scary, or happy stories that it can tell you. It can tell you audible or Amazon rapids. I prefer Amazon Rapids because it has a different voice for every character, where as Audible reads to you with one voice. So the stories from Amazon Rapids are more interesting and they are shorter than the Audible stories so, if you fall asleep listening to one it just turns off when it ends, which shouldn’t be long. Some of my favorite stories are the Danger and Eggs series, the tricky sitter, and the dad store. I hope you try out Amazon Rapids and I hope you enjoy!"

B073X5FYVF,Amazon Storytime,Kids,JnS,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst Skill Ever Created,"Reviewed in the United States on November 17, 2021","Ta Ta. See ya soon raccoon. My feedback should be focused on specific features of the ""product"". OK. Whoever is responsible for creating this skill should have realized that adding an utterance when you turn it off was a bad idea. Why. Because this is a bedtime skill and the last thing you want is for it to yell some unnecessary nonsense when you turn it off. Why. It risks waking your sleeping kids up. This skill was poorly thought-out and poorly planned. It's an absolute stain on the skills portfolio."
B073X5FYVF,Amazon Storytime,Kids,Spencer C Ackers,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Son enjoys the stories, but they will play endlessly once started","Reviewed in the United States on March 23, 2021","While there are not a ton of stories (we've now heard all of them multiple times over the course of a few months), my son still enjoys them.The biggest problems are with regard to controlling it as a parent. As other reviewers have mentioned, it will play endlessly unless told to stop. Also, unlike some other skills, you cannot tell it to stop from another Alexa device (neither by voice on another Echo nor through the Alexa smartphone app). You're only option is to stop them from the device they are playing on, which can be a problem when your child is sleeping in that room. Sure, you can set device limits so that your child cannot use the device during certain time periods, but that's not a proper solution."

OK, I'm the parent and my voice is mapped but you can't verbally give permission. ""I have sent a link to the home page of your Alexa app"" yup, there it is on my app home, great. I click the link and am given a choice to disable skill as a button or click a link for the terms of service, which are dated as last updated nearly 18 months ago, July 2020. From here one would expect the OK/enable/accept button or link but THERE IS NONE. I have spent 15 minutes going through the app, the web page.... there is NO METHOD to grant permission. Yet again Amazon has implemented code based on an incomplete use case that doesn't work. Great job folks. Just delete the skill if you don't support it, Amazon."
B073X5FYVF,Amazon Storytime,Kids,Alexandria,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Works well but why flood it with bratty, disrespectful characters?","Reviewed in the United States on June 30, 2021","This app is working just fine for us. There have been no issues. The recording include varying voices and great sound effects. I think they've done a good job to start off with. They could continue on and expand I think.Some of the stories are cute and pretty creative and my 5 year old enjoys them. I do take major issue though with how so many of the characters have horrible attitudes, are extremely disrespectful to the parents, the friends or anyone else and there is no teaching moment or character development. The kids in the story just get to be nasty and mean or bratty and that's it. I've taken the time to explain that it is never ok to treat someone like those characters do and how to handle it when he is spoken to like that because yes, in real life that happens often. I just don't think ""storytime"" is the time to be flooded with it Amazon. Seriously.PLEASE AMAZON, put stories on your app for kids that have kids that are KIND to their friends, love their family members, learn something wholesome, or learn conflict resolution or just have FUN! It doesn't have to be a big, in-depth, spell it out for them, sappy thing.  The characters don't need to be mean for the listeners to be engaged. There are much more uplifting stories out there I know it.I really hope you guys listen to the many reviews with these concerns. I think Storytime is a fantastic idea and you're doing a great job with delivery. Please give us some better characters."
B073X5FYVF,Amazon Storytime,Kids,Mel,2.0 out of 5 stars,I love and hate this...,"Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2019","My kids love Amazon storytime. Even if we read to them, which we regularly do, it's a good way to get them to bed. They enjoy the stories, even though it doesn't seem like there's a lot of depth (yet) for each type, the pool of story types seems to be getting wider though, which is good.I like that more than one story plays now, it send to get the kids to sleep faster.Here's what I don't like:*It takes a bit of time to turn on. Alexa doesn't always hear them say 'family' or 'bedtime' when they say the type of story either.*It's really loud when you ask it to stop. I have verbose mode off, but ending storytime is practically a story itself. It's enough that my five year old has been roused from her sleep more than once.*There's no good way to turn it off quietly from my phone or another Alexa device. I most often go into my kids room and unplug the device. It's the fastest and quietest way to stop it. Please give us a quick way to stop this immediately (and quietly) from a smartphone or another echo enabled device. [Edit] I have recently been able to stop the storytime mode from another device. It also makes the announcement that it's stopping on the device that heard you. Great improvement! [/Edit]"

I wish Amazon would continue to add content."

These are better defined as radio shows or audio plays.  There is no narration, so at times it is difficult to imagine what is going on in the scene of the 'story'.

Anytime I ask for a bedtime story, it plays the same one, which is “Glow” by Raymond Bean.  I don’t nessecarily “love” “like” or “hate” it, but it isn’t my favorite skill. However, I will give kudos for the voice acting, because the voices fit the story and the actors use a lot of expression."

B073X5FYVF,Amazon Storytime,Kids,Cindie,1.0 out of 5 stars,*Not Impressed*,"Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2021","Asked for a mystery for my 12 yr old granddaughter and what I got was about a 3 minute story for a 4 yr old. about a mama chick who lost her eggs, asked for help from a policeman who found them hatched behind the chicken coop. Then the chicks stole his glasses. The End. I'm guessing it was meant to be cute but fell way short. First of all I expected a real story. Secondly, there's no way a 3 minute story is holding any kids interest.  Stories are usually meant for quiet time, naptime and bedtime. Three minutes won't do diddly. If I have to load story after story every 3-5 minutes I may as well read a story myself.  At least it will be worth listening to and long enough to put the kid to sleep. Lastly the voices were terrible. The mama chick sounded like a man trying to sound like a woman. Sooo sad. Well Amazon you really missed the boat on this one. A great opportunity tossed into the wind. Such a disappointment.....it should be scrapped and start over. Honestly Amazon, I'm embarrassed for you."

B073X5FYVF,Amazon Storytime,Kids,Varying Degrees Of Right,3.0 out of 5 stars,No Option to Playback Story by Title or Author,"Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2022","As of now, there is no feature that enables users to playback a specific story title from the Storytime skill.  My daughter falls asleep with Storytime stories nearly every night, but she is at the age where she wants to hear everything over & over again.  It has been proven that children listen to, play, & watch their favorite media on repeat because it helps with their cognitive development, allowing them to analyze & process words & ideas with each repeated playback. Not to mention that a familiar, safe story is a great way to fend off potential nightmares. However, Amazon Storytime only allows you to select the category of story (animals, princesses, superheros, silly, etc.), or randomize the story selection by ""spinning the wheel.""  What is missing is the ability to replay specific Story Titles, or even authors of favored stories, directly from the voice-activated skill.  Something like, ""Alexa, open Storytime to Animals, and play the story 'The Thing'!"" Or ""Alexa, open Storytime. [category prompt] Author Brad White's titles.""  That added feature would bump this up to a 5-star review from us!"

However, either there aren’t many stories or it doesn’t have a good random generator. We have heard the same stories over and over. You can skip a story but even when we skip over and over in each category we never hear any new stories. It’s a shame because they are short which is great for bedtime, and he loves being able to ask Alexa to read him a story. It also seems like most of the stories are by the same author, and personally I just find some of the voices obnoxious. Now I’m paying for a udible so we can get better stories.

They can’t even skip a story, there are tons of stories on there where people are being mean to each other, which both kids say they do NOT want to hear at bedtime, but even my husband can’t communicate with Amazon Storytime. Do you realize how frustrating it is after you’ve tucked them in and kissed them goodnight and are trying to finish the dishes and you need to run upstairs every 5 min because Alexa won’t listen to your kid on the skill DESIGNED FOR CHILDREN!!!

B073X5FYVF,Amazon Storytime,Kids,summer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Kid likes it, but definite room for improvement","Reviewed in the United States on December 24, 2018","My 7 year old enjoys this, but while the stories are told at a decent pace, there are several things we don’t like.  Firstly, she would like to be able to recall the stories she really enjoys.  It’s a total random replaying of stories, so you can’t find ones you enjoy.  They also replay one after the other.  She has fallen asleep listening to it, and I’ve heard it playing by itself at 10 pm. We’ve tried asking Alexa to play this for 10 minutes, but tha feature doesn’t work with this like it does with music.  As a parent, there are some really weird stories at times.  Finally, she wishes there was more variety.  She’s heard many stories repeatedly, though it seems there have been new stories for the holidays.  The skill could be made better."

My son thoroughly enjoyed the first story he heard and wanted to hear it again but unfortunately there is no feature for that (asking for a story by name, nor asking to repeat the last story DOES not work). The skill simply selects a random story from a database and reads it out (as simple as it gets in terms or programming). The skill could have utilized the screen on the Echo Show but it did not (such as showing 6 different stories available on the screen as a page and have user select one of them). Perhaps the developers could fine-tune these minor but important details to help children in their enjoyment of the skill."

B073X5FYVF,Amazon Storytime,Kids,InquisitiveMomTrailblazer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Keep updating to keep 5 stars! Our kids 3 and 8 love it!,"Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2019","I bet it's difficult to please all these parents since the reviews often include requests for opposite things.  Could you include your website/e-mail so we can provide more detailed feedback requests? Also I bet many, including myself, would love to help your team develop more stories and make this skill a huge success.  Here are some issues and ideas to solve them in the meantime:1. Stories don't work for all ages:**Have 3 or 4 age groups for child to choose from first. Then they can choose type of story.2.  Announcer between stories is loud and disruptive:**When first starting this skill, Alexa can say ""if you'd like to make changes during storytime but don't know how, just say ""Alexa, what are my storytime options.""""**Or between stories Alexa could WHISPER a very short sentence to about options.3.  Stories play all night and never stop: (personally we like this because the abrupt stop wakes my child up. Go figure.)**When skill first starts, ask child how many stories they'd like to hear.**Allow us to go to a website to personalize the skill with age group and amount of stories.**Allow us to use the LOOP function we use in many other skills. LOOP means the stories will continue non-stop.4. Bedtime stories aren't all good for bedtime. Many have too much action, loud voices and stimulating stories:**Age group would put quieter stories in the youngest age group.**Or...child/parent could ask for soothing, relaxing or active bedtime stories.**Youngest age group bedtime stories would ask a child/parent whether they'd like the stories read by single person (less stimulating) or characters.  Or we go to the website to personalize this how we want it.Thanks for listening! Contact me if you are hiring readers."

B073X5FYVF,Amazon Storytime,Kids,Olga,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not available in FreeTime and lack of control,"Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2019","This skill is nice, but it's not available in FreeTime. I have enabled FreeTime for the Echo Dot in my kids room, which is a great feature to limit to kids safe content. And even though this skill is made for kids, it's not available with that setting! Doesn't make any sense...Also, can't return to the story you just listened to, even when calling it by exact name. Unfortunate, because everyone knows kids like to listen to same story over and over again.And lastly, would be nice if I could stop it from my phone/tablet without having to go to my kid's room. In case he fell asleep listening to a series of ninja stories."

B073X5FYVF,Amazon Storytime,Kids,Kelly Ridgway,3.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful but some issues,"Reviewed in the United States on March 15, 2019","We love this skill, as it has completely changed our kids bedtime routine.  I would give it 5 stars except it has started interrupting itself when it tells you to say “Alexa open Storytime”.  The whole thing pauses because Alexa is spoken.  Also since we use it for bedtime there is a story where the characters sing and it is the most awful thing in the world - wakes my daughter up every time.  Also, when my daughter is asleep and we fell Alexa to stop, it says quite loudly “bye bye butterfly” which often causes the kids to wake up or stir as well.  Other than these few issues, which weren’t present until a short time ago, we absolutely love this and it has been a bedtime lifesaver."

They use the same adult voice actors with ridiculous ""children's"" voices for many of them and they consist of two characters arguing back in forth in these voices, teaching communication styles and terms that I wouldn't want my 5-year old to learn to think of as a normal way of talking to other children. They insult each other and make fun of each other for most of the stories. I also don't like that there is no feature to block (not just disable) content you don't want your child to accidentally re-enable since all it takes to re-enable this after I disable it is Alexa asking my daughter ""would you like to activate this skill again?"""

B073X5FYVF,Amazon Storytime,Kids,Shannon,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Too few stories, most of mediocre quality.","Reviewed in the United States on August 28, 2018","Most of the stories are actually more like skits, with only dialogue and no narration or storyline. Having listened to them many times now because they repeat (there are only so many stories, so after a month I'd heard them all). Way too many stories with kids bickering, annoying fake kid voices, or just straight up bad role models.Most stories aren't *so* terrible, they're more innocuous and forgettable, some droll, some inspid. My kids did like it enough, but I disabled it after hearing the same ""stories"" (again, most are like skits with just dialogue). The breaking point was a brother and sister exchange with an (often used) annoying fake kid voice and nothing but bickering. I hear that enough in my own house without it coming out of the Echo.I really think it would be better if they had more real stories from Audible. However, for whatever reason, my kids tend to skip the ""real"" stories and just want to listen to the skits. It would also be much better if there were more in general, so I didn't have to hear the same stories, good or bad, over and over.Edit: somehow the kids managed to get it back, even though I disabled the skill from my phone."

We stopped using it because it only seems to want to tell us this one story about a swamp of sorrow. The creepy suspense style and scary monster voice scared our 4 year old. She hated it. I tried over and over to change to a different story, but it just kept saying ""ok"" and then automatically selecting the next volume of the swamp of sorrow. Once it got to volume 4 i just gave up and played an audiobook from her tablet. So it isn't good for our needs, but for kids who can listen to any genre of story it would probably be a big hit."

B073X5FYVF,Amazon Storytime,Kids,billie-jo bean,5.0 out of 5 stars,stop complaining,"Reviewed in the United States on June 1, 2021","I see a lot of negative comments towards amizon about this feature, a feature I dont use by the way. The only problem I see is a bunch of complaining parents who dont have a babysitter for bedtime. If you cant stop for 10min to personally spend quality 1 on 1 time with your children before bed, then the problem is you not amizon. We wonder why children are acting the way they do now of days, well heres an example of why. Children need to be read to, they need quality 1 on 1 time each day or their going to act out and much worse as time goes on. I find it hard to believe that not 1 parent finds it wrong that alexa is reading to your child and not the parent. That is so sad for so many reasons, I enjoy that nighttime 1 on 1 time with my children, thats our time and after a busy day we both need that quality time together. We wonder why children of this generation act the way they do. Heres a perfect example of why, shame on all of you for complaining about amizon and not looking at yourselves as the problem instead for not taking 10 min to be with your children, who desperately need that 1 on 1 time. Electronics are not parents and their not babysitters, people try being parents instead and read to your children yourself instead of letting alexa do your job for you. Shame on all of you, everyone knows children who are personally read to enjoy reading more and succeed more. Shame on you for stunting your kids growth personally and academically. Be a parent."

B07CR8G7DV,counting coach,Kids,Eweforia,5.0 out of 5 stars,Counts slowly out loud--perfect for exercises,"Reviewed in the United States on July 25, 2019","Update: Thank you developers for returning the slow  counting speed back to its previous slow speed. This app is the ONLY one available that simply counts out loud. Not a stopclock, not a metronome, not a child' learn numbers tool. I'm back to happily giving this app a 5-star review.Previous: I've been happily using this app for over a year to count reps for some exercises I do and up until today, I would have given it a 5 star review. I liked that I could ask the count to be VERY SLOW. Today, that slow speed has dramatically increased, preventing me from being able to complete a weight lift in time before the next number is counted. Developer, please revert to the timing speed you used prior to today."
B01EKKF81Q,Nanny State,Kids,She Who is Unnamed,4.0 out of 5 stars,"please confirm with a parental ""UNIT""","Reviewed in the United States on September 24, 2016","it's basic . .. and asks:""is your room tidy?""  if you answer Yes, it next asks:""have you practiced your instrument?""  if you answer Yes, it next asks:""is your homework done?""  if you answer Yes, it next asks:""are your chores done?""  if you answer Yes, it next asks:""do you have screen time (TV) privileges?""  if you answer Yes, it says""congratulation you have screentime, please confirm with a parental unit.""if you answer No, it says ""No Screens for you"" ...I about fell on the floor laughing when it said please confirm with a parental ""UNIT"".I hate to brag but I, yes me, She Who is Unnamed, I, invented the phrase parental unit, I started saying that well OVER 35 plus years ago. That's why I am laughing. And why I added an extra 🌟. But a 3 star rating is because, as follows:if adjusting the questions were available this would be better, considering every student doesn't play an instrument, and since a majority of schools have eliminated their music programs, and every child who might want to play an instrument doesn't always have access to instruments to practice, but they might have something else that the ability to change or adjust ""practice"" here would apply, or be able to insert options for special projects in addition to homework...  also, customizing options, to be able to adjust by person... Not all children are the same, even in the same family.  But this is an awesome starting for an app of this type. wish this was availaible when my kids were little - 25 plus years too late - one last side note would be to add features for grandma's, for when the little ones visit."

Now that we're in, the app seems kinda fun, but now I'm worried about what exactly I've given permission for. If takes 7 steps to confirm, there must have been some malicious fine print...

Love it!  I have a 4th generation dot in the living room and a 3rd generation echo show in the kitchen, both Hey Santa enabled.  We are all adults here in the household but Santa is fun to communicate with for sure.  I've read the other reviews and just have to shake my head at the people who probably have the older version of the Echo and are ranting because the Hey Santa doesn't work on their dots, they really need to take up reading and see that there is a notation that the personality doesn't work on some devices.  Anyway I am looking forward to Santa sharing some Christmas songs and chatter later today."

B017OBZR50,The Name Game (banana-fana),Kids,jjaquinta,1.0 out of 5 stars,Looks like something written during an Amazon Developer Day,"Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2015","Another Amazonian cranking out a skill.Ease of Use: 3 out of 5. In the past I've given full marks to trivial interfaces. I'm changing my mind now. There isn't really anything to this interface, therefore there wasn't actually any design in it. So from this skill forward I'm only giving trivial interfaces neutral marks.Ironically, this will pull this skill up.Usefulness: 1 out of 5. This does exactly what it says. It takes a name, and mangles it in some child's rhyme. The problem is that the pacing is off, much like when it reads Knock-Knock jokes (which is why my skill breaks it up!) The most fun I had with this was trying to tick Alexa into saying dirty words.Novelty: 2 out of 5. OK, so no one has done a word mangling skill before. I'm not really sure this is a bad thing. Maybe translating into pig latin is next.Overall: 1 out of 5. This looks and plays like something someone thought of and wrote during an Amazon Developer Day. It took almost no effort to do, and really doesn't achieve much."

Poole,2.0 out of 5 stars,Is this just random?,"Reviewed in the United States on September 28, 2018","I guess if you want Alexa to randomly assign chores to a list of people this would work for you. I was looking for Alexa to keep track of whose turn it actually IS to do something among my 3 kids, so it being random doesn’t work for us. I just don’t want the kids arguing every day about whose turn it is to do a specific chore (we rotate) so wish I could set up a chore rota and Alexa could keep track. This doesn’t seem to do this...and there are no instructions anywhere so I have no idea how it works or how to set it up."

From there on, it is a crapshoot to figure out what Alexa will do. Some of the time it picks a random name from the helpers list (where can I make this a recurrent weekly list for each helper??), another time ""Sorry, I'm not sure"". The next time ""Table wear are dishes, …"" then goes on some random rant about completely useless information about the restaurant industry. Then ""Hmmm, I don't know that one"". Really?? And I got an email today from Amazon touting the benefits of the ""Whose turn"" app. Shouldn't you guys make sure it works before mass-emailing your customers about an app (with a great potential) that does not work?"

I tried to remove these names and it keeps saying, “Turn is not in your list of people, “ or “Apple is not in your list of people.” Therefore I can not edit the list to select from. It is also a random selection. It keeps selecting the same child over and over. It doesn’t switch turns often and is ” NOT FAIR” - Just ask my kid.

B08VWHTT2R,Monster Guard,Kids,mthomas,5.0 out of 5 stars,My kids love Monty!!!,"Reviewed in the United States on February 24, 2021","My oldest daughter was scared of monsters in her closet when she was 5 or 6 and this didn't exist then...  She eventually grew out of it, but I can't tell you how many nights her pragmatic dad tried to explain that monsters don't exist. It was the same conversation night after night for about a year.Now my youngest is 6 and its happening all over again.  Both our girls have Dots in their rooms so I decided to search for something that might help.  There are a couple of monster type skills, but this is by far, hands down the best.  Monty is so lovable and trustworthy and the way he 'activates' the room is nothing short of genius.  It varies slightly night after night so it doesn't feel taped.  Credit to the company who thought this one up.  Great job!"

Simple enough to work.  I only have two issues (or maybe it's one in the same).  The game seems to randomly stop.  Also, if she doesn't give an answer fast enough the game stops and she has to restart it.  I like the activation phrase.  It's simple and easy to remember.  I'd like to see some score keeping ability or incentive (badges for perfecting a table).  I'd also like for her to remember which ones my kids got wrong and repeat them randomly until they are correct.  Maybe have a kid profile option.  Overall, a nice app."

We are going to disable the skill now,  but will check back to see if there are updates/fixes later and would try it again then."

Did someone actually write their own app that works just for their family?  So strange."

I wouldn’t be talking to her at the time or asking her a question and she would do this.  Please work out the kinks in this program.

B07BB4WWB3,Disney Stories,Kids,Megan bacon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Still love it... but needs improvement.,"Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2021","There is an absolute love/annoyed relationship I have with this skill... Which stories are the long ones? Have a list... but no times? Why can't it do ""would you like another story?"" and simply say ""yes"" would be great. Sucks that you go all the way back out to start again. My kids would fall asleep so fast if it would just play at least 3 in a row. They literally wake up to ask to open again.  Make it more like sound machine style and it would be a solid 4 star. Make it to where we knew which one the long stories are and it could be a 5 star. We love the app and my kids listen to it nightly now. However, a few changes could make it to where we don't even need our sound machines. Also the short stories could be less short... some are really short and have to start skill all over again like every 1-2 minutes:/ Still love it, but needs much improvement."

It was our favorite math skill when we could use but but reporting the issue does nothing, we have gotten no respone after weeks. shame."
B0797Y6HNY,Amazon Math,Kids,Terra,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fun and interactive for all ages,"Reviewed in the United States on July 16, 2021","I love that this app not only starts naturally asking harder or easier questions based on performance, but also lets kids choose topics and difficulty levels in a naturally conversational way. It's also great that it gives second chances to try again rather than just saying it's wrong and moving on.Even my 3 year old was able to figure it out within the first few minutes of trying. She'll say, ""Let's do counting"" and then she takes turns counting with Alexa. When Alexa asks which number she wants to count by, my daughter will try by 10s or 5s or whatever, and she enjoys the challenge. Sometimes Alexa doesn't understand what my daughter says, and she'll say something like, ""I didn't understand that. We're counting by 1s. What comes after 12?"" and then my daughter will have another chance to answer.As a former math teacher, I love that you can choose a grade level to start with and then it provides math concepts and questions that are consistent with that grade's standards, but also differentiates higher or lower depending on performance, without telling the kids that they are now 'working in a lower grade level' or anything like that. She'll also double check with you to see if you'd like to try easier or harder problems, based on your performance, and the questions will get more difficult but stay within the same concept, rather than switching abruptly from multiplication to division or something like that.Overall, this is a solid math practice skill. Alexa understands a wide variety of inputs too which makes it easy to navigate without having to remember specific commands. I only wish that there were more moments of silliness and bigger celebrations, as my kiddo would probably get a kick out of that."

My husband enabled it over the weekend and our 6-year-old is EXCITED to brush his teeth now. We have a 2-minute timer, but he tends to stare at it and not engage with the actual tooth brushing. I love that this gives kids fun facts to focus on but also gives them useful tips such as switching sides, brushing each tooth, etc. And it leaves them hanging, telling them they'll learn the answer to a question, for example, when they come back to brush that night! So clever. I love that it's themed, too, so he's learning about Halloween this week. Would give six stars if I could."

For example, I ended up telling my kids not to brush their tongue until after the program has finished instead of doing it in the middle like the program instructs. The progress counter resets, making it pointless. And their songs are not awesome. I'd love to find a different app. I like the trivia it shares and it's fun for the most part.

B079WCGTKX,Chompers,Kids,Krysbarr,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Superb app, BUT","Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2018","First the bad...1.) It is so hard for Alexa to understand the word ""CHOMPERS"". It is near impossible for my 6 year old son to start this skill. It has actually upset him to the point of tears after trying probably over 20 times in a row to start the skill. Sometimes it's hard for me to start it. I've tried ""start Chompers"", ""play Chompers"", ""start Chompers skill"", ""brush my teeth with Chompers"", and just any combination of words with ""Chompers"" to get her to understand. Choppers is just not an easy word for the age group of kids that would be using this to pronounce and you all know how frustrating Alexa can be when she never understands what you, as an adult, is saying. I wish the start word or phrase was easier to pronounce and Alexa could understand better. Also, when I inevitably have to start the skill, it takes so long to start that you think it didn't start and you keep waking Alexa and repeatedly tell her to start Chompers.2.) I wish it instructed you to brush your tongue, floss, use mouth wash and rinse your toithbrush. I'm thoroughly happy with it as it is, this would just be a huge added benefit. Hopefully it will get added.The easiest way we've found to help avoid the pronounciation/Alexa's poor comprehension is I use Alexa on my Fire tablet to start Chompers and then give it to my son to take to the bathroom to listen. When you start it on your tablet a screen pops up where I can pause it so he has enough time to get it to the bathroom and get ready to brush and he can press play whenever he's ready.The good...I cannot praise this app enough! Such a simple but genius idea. It's had to get kids to clean anything, especially for a full 2 minutes twice a day. I love brushing my teeth, but it's hard for me to do 2 minutes of it twice a day because I have Rheumatoid Arthritis and it's incredibly painful to do nothing but brush for 2 minutes only thinking about how bad it's hurting your hand. Distraction is the mother of pain relief and this fascinating, twice daily, two minute program is a fantastic distraction and a great and fun fact learning adventure for kids and adults! My son loves sharing what he learns from Chompers. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this app for both my son and me!!!"

My daughter was disappointed but understood things aren’t always perfect. We started over. Then tonight after another 52 days it reset back to 0 again.After the second reset my daughter is done using it. She doesn’t want to be disappointed again. I have disabled the app and have encouraged others in my family to do the same.However, during those times that it did keep our progress my daughter and I did enjoy the 2 minutes.

I played around with my Alexa settings and switched the Fuzzable off and on between tries. I finally got it paired. My daughter was happy. It’s really for small children. Maybe 2 or 3 because it really is mostly for the cute factor. Kids 5 and older will get board after 5 min. I figured why not, it’s cute, it’s on flash sale and I have multiple house hold items that are Alexa activated. We thought the ears would light up better too. All-in-all it’s cute and mainly for very small children. A word of advice- do not give up when it won’t pair. Try activating kids mode in your Alexa app first before you pair.

So when my daughter wants Alexa to read a book to her, she could snuggle up with the Fuzzible on a cushion in the living room or in bed and listen to the book.  Or at night as she falls asleep, could listen to quiet sleeping music next to her.

Very Cute, i tried it out for a min,Our daughter is out w/gma but i think shell love it as a Alexa and Plush Lover...(she's 4) The Bunnies name is Fluffy or Fluff..Alexa translates, It plays games, Takes turns making up and story telling with child.

B078X55Q5F,The Queen's Mathematician,Kids,Lauren Howsosn,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fabulous, creative adventure game, with math!","Reviewed in the United States on January 26, 2018","This is a fantastic and creative choose-your-own-adventure game in which you must navigate through a variety of math challenges (rec. for ages 6-8) to ultimately save the Queen. There are plenty of non-math choices to determine the course of your adventure, meaning you'll likely never have the same adventure twice. (Really well designed!) My 4.5-year-old can't do all the math yet, but she begs to do this adventure together every evening.  Pro tip: if you need more time to solve a problem, just ask Alexa to ""repeat"". Otherwise, she will time out, thinking that the game has been abandoned."
B078X55Q5F,The Queen's Mathematician,Kids,Keith,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really enjoyed this game,"Reviewed in the United States on February 2, 2018","Really enjoyed this game.  It's a combination of choose-your-own-adventure and math skills.  I played it initially on my own and then later with a 7 year old (who then wanted to play again).  The story follows you, a mathematician, as you attempt to save your queen from crafty elves.  Making decisions as you go, you find your way through a rich environment, passing mathematical barriers in an effort to rescue the queen.  Really well done, with good replay-ability thanks to the variety of paths and the randomization of the puzzles.  The story is told very well, and the sound effects are perfect (this skill makes excellent use of Alexa's voice, adding inflection and tones that I haven't heard before).  We actually turned the lights out for the second playing and the experience was even better.  Very enjoyable - I highly recommend it."

B078W3FKR9,Miss Arcade,Kids,cherbat,2.0 out of 5 stars,I was super excited when I saw this skill,"Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2018","I was super excited when I saw this skill.  I am a homeschooller with 6 and 7 year old boys.  They struggle to get their daily tasks completed.  I was hoping this skill could help us all keep track.  I find a few issues.1.  You can't set up multiple children.2.  I am a very clear speaking person, but it doesn't recognize what I am saying very well.3.  Most importantly and most annoying, it shutts down after one command.  If you have asked Alexa to open the Magic door, you will understand how she can ask questions, wait for your feedback, then ask another question.  You would think that this skill would allow you to set up a task, ask how many stars, and then ask if you need to add another task or reward, etc.  But, it does not.  When I say add a task.  It asks how many stars it is worth.  When I answer, it shuts down the skill.  If I want to add another task, I must ask Alexa to open the task again.Also, the skill only gives the options to Add a Task, Add  new reward, or list tasks.  It would be helpful to make it easier to mark tasks as complete or remove tasks.  With some additional work, I started with two tasks to try it out.  I was able to remove the first task.  When I tried to remove the second task, it says it doesn't exist because it is not recognizing my voice well, and you need to pronounce it exactly the same way.  If would be easier if you could have it read the tasks, and ask if you want to mark it or skip to next.  This could be of great benefit to a busy mom like me, and my kids would feel like they have more self reliance, but not until some improvements are made.  Currently disabling."

Once I saw how much mine like it, I realized why it was necessary for them to ensure that children have obtained parental permission. Since the skill requires (collecting and) parsing my child’s voice to give the desired response, it made sense they needed both approval to collect their personal data and verify I am me. I haven’t seen anything else about my child that they have asked for or collected.The location and facts were fun, even if the facts started to cycle somewhat quickly. Also, there was a bit of struggle asking the suggested “when will Santa arrive?” question."

Also, when Alexa gives a challenge problem,  and you take some time to answer,  Alexa just shuts the game off. i also wish the game would save progress instead of starting over at 0 depth each time."

The 5-minute sessions are the perfect length for little ones, and the guidance is just right for kids to follow along. Our girls love the creature voices, and can't wait each day to listen to the next one and see which friends of Cool Koala will be on board.

So far, my 4 and 6 year old have done two days of meditation and are ready for the third: The liked it so much they repeated the first day three times, and the second one two times. I'd say my 4 year-old may be a little young, but she still enjoys and benefits from the session, while my 6 year-old is a perfect age!

Change into pajamas, go to the bathroom, wash hands, brush teeth, wash face, get into bed and “Alexa, start Cool Koala.”Every night is something different, but each skill they teach is a tried and true mediation technique. They are short, so kids can manage it.I use this with our 6 and 9 year old who share a room. They have different bedtime needs. One is full of energy and wants to be silly. The other is full of anxiety and needs to relax. But they both need to calm down. And that’s what Cool Koala does.It hasn’t solved the nighttime waking issues of our 9 year old, but it has made bedtime much more manageable. He looks forward to the meditation every night and I’ve caught him using the calming techniques during the day when his anxiety explodes."

Over & over, 7-8 times we asked her for more & I now expected a repeat of a prev one, after seeing the over reactive scathing review from a ‘Karen’ who seemed INSULTED her 2nd POOP POEM echoed her 1st POOP POEM! like  maybe she felt entitled to a POOP SONNET!! 😘Anyway, after my string of all unique 💩prose … the last 1, she delivered was the classic “10 little monkeys jumpin on the bed…” rhyme and my MONKEY, smart girl that she is, raised her napping head & looked Alexa’s way, like “WHAT? I HEARD YOU… WHAT DO YOU WANT?!” then looked at each of us like “WTF?” & walked out of the room annoyed! We were all howling.So… in closing… I had way too much fun with this review but THIS SKILL WAS GREAT FUN, ALL 💩 💩 & GIGGLES…  some of these ridiculous critics of it, obviously think their 💩 doesn’t stink & need to lighten up.!Seriously?!
