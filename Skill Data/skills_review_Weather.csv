B079K37QYF,My AcuRite,Weather,GBushNYC,2.0 out of 5 stars,This skill is not ready for roll out. Not a good skill as is.,"Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2018","I've waited a while for this skill, unfortunately it's not ready for roll out if you have multiple sensors and have multiple accounts. I use AcuRite everywhere, my summer house, my home and my elderly parents house. We are definitely power users with almost every kind of sensor they sell being used.That said, it is annoying to have to scroll through all devices to get to the one you want to hear conditions for. The senors are labeled, we should be able to ask for a specific one. Would also love to be able to switch between the 3 different accounts I have with AcuRite through Alexa. I currently follow all 3 accounts so they should at least allow us to monitor all accounts from our dashboard. Also do not like the fact it limits us to 7 devices. We have more than 7 with the ones outside and in multiple rooms just in our home base. Yes, we are using the old hub that handles more, as well as the new hub with the 7 device limit. They should recognize there are still people out there using the old hub.If you are using a wifi monitoring system like AcuRite, you probably set it up because you need something more than a regular thermometer. The Alexa skill should reflect the needs of your users and this just doesn't - hopefully yet."

(this is for some that may have more than two stations i guess). I think it would be much better without this, something in the settings where you could toggle this on or off, im guessing most people only have one sensor/station anyway.One other thing that could be improved is the weather when played on a tv with a fire stick. It does show a text version of pretty much what the echo plays, but would be much better if there was an actual display along with the voice announcement, something resembling the icons showing on the weather station display."

B079K37QYF,My AcuRite,Weather,Warren,3.0 out of 5 stars,Needs more capabilities to initiate notifications to Alexa,"Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2018","I have too many Acurite sensors across to many buildings and am adding more.  Your system is wondering and I love it.  it allows me to monitor my vacation home, parents home and office easily via my iphone.The issue with the Alexa skills is that it doesn't push notifications.  I have a lot of sensors and quite frankly I can't remember all of the names and don't want to go down an entire list.  What is needed is for AcuRite and Alexa to be integrated to allow for notifications when alerts that I have set are triggered.Right now when Alexa has its normal blue right showing up as a yellow ring  I know I have a notification and simply ask Alexa for my 'notification'.  Right now that is done for arriving packages coming from Amazon.When an temperature or leak event that I have requested information about happens the Alexa unit should show the same notification ring color and be able to let me know what has triggered the notification, ""Basement temperature went below 34 degrees.""  It already sends me texts and emails so please just send me an Alexa notification also.There is an obvious chance that Alexa will not allow you to do that, but that is what your app needs.  It appears however that Amazon will allow it;Look here;  https://developer.amazon.com/docs/alexa-voice-service/notifications-overview.html"

B01GU4MBM4,Big Sky¬Æ,Weather,Mr. Luigi,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Solid Weather Skill. But, no information about premium pricing.","Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2019","I just read through paragraph after paragraph about the additional functionalities the premium subscription offers. But, nowhere does the developer provide pricing for the premium service on its Amazon page. Imagine any other Amazon product page that says everything and anything about a product but leaves out the cost! I eventually did some online searching and found that if I went to FAQ's one of the questions was, ""How much does premium cost?"" It's crazy to make customers go on such a wild goose chase for this information. Does the developer think that by not providing pricing information it will encourage more folks to sign-up for the premium service? Not this customer! Speaking of the premium experience, I was disappointed that ""Snow"" was not one of the offered notifications. Considering how few quality weather skills are available for Alexa (a glaring weakness in the platform), Big Sky will probably continue to thrive. But, I encourage the developer to prepare for the rainy days ahead when there is more competition in the weather skill arena. Be upfront about your product. Don't make customers search for the cost of your services."

B01GU4MBM4,Big Sky¬Æ,Weather,thetechjester,5.0 out of 5 stars,(UPDATE) I've been hijacked by Big Sky,"Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2022","Big Sky updated the ability to be removed as the default weather app.Now the sun is shining, the birds are chirping, the planets have all aligned and my Alexa and I are at one with the weather universe again.THANK YOU SO MUCH for addressing this issue.Big Sky is, once again, my favorite (hyper-local) app!  Upgraded back to my original 5 stars. Once you've ironed out some of the kinks (BigS as default but when I ask for hourly weather I get 7 day forecast, and playing nice with my Flash briefing I would consider making it the default a more permanent solution). Until then i am more than content with invoking BigSky for my detailed weather needs.Changed from 4 stars to 1.This skill WAS awesome. Yes, having to say ""Alexa, Ask Big Sky...."" was tedious, but it worked. Then on Jan 2, 2022, I was prompted to make Big Sky my default weather app by saying ""Alexa, I prefer Big Sky for my weather updates."". I thought, ""this would be great!"". That was a command I now completely regret initiating to my poor, unsuspecting Alexa.Now:1. Daily Briefings no longer work correctly.2. Asking for the hourly weather makes Big Sky give me a seven day forecast.3. There is no ""undo this horrible chaos"" command I can give Alexa to free her from Big Sky's firm grip on the weather-verse. The only path to freedom was to completely disable Big Sky.I really hope they get this fixed. As much as I love the hyper-local weather Big Sky *did* deliver, I don't think they tested this enough to be ready for ""prime time"". At the very least their FAQ page (or the skill itself) should give instructions on how to undo this option instead of requiring a complete removal of the Big Sky skill. Oh and *if* you re-enable the skill, the mess starts all over again.So I am leaving the skill disabled until I can see on the FAQ or forums or a direct email from customer support (based on other posts, not holding my breath for this option) that they have this corrected."
B01GU4MBM4,Big Sky¬Æ,Weather,Lunartic/Author,3.0 out of 5 stars,"WAS a Great skill, but...","Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2018","One of the best skills offered by Alexa, until yesterday... This skill gives/gave the most detailed weather information and included sunrise/sunset times. Whereas this skill would give you forecast information for several days in advance when specifically requested, it now only tries to sell you a premium version when you ask for anything other than the current day's weather info.. The fee is not much at all, but if this is a sign of things to come, or a test to see if this will fly; I'd rather not step on that slippery slope.  One week ago, I would have given this 5 stars with a rave review, but I'll have to give only 3 until this is resolved. Though it is more detailed than the default weather report from Alexa, at least the default weather skill will give you a 7-day forecast."

I was outside. In the weather.I live in monsoon country where temperatures range 40F in a day, and I think this app is awesome! Predicts the afternoon storms with very reliable timing. I love listening to the weather predictions several times a day. I find the command to ""Open Big Sky"" easier than asking the question to Alexa in default mode.Everyone makes mistakes, and this was just one of those things. Don't pay attention to the naysayers who had bad timing (especially just after Prime Day, and most likely just setting up the Echo). I hope everyone who tried will set it up again, give it a shot, and fix review accordingly.Thank you to the developer of Big Sky! This is definitely a favorite, daily use app."

The problem is that the account linking page does not allow me to submit most of the time, and when if does, it says there is an error and the account cannot be linked. I have had this issue for months ever since I deleted the skill and reinstalled it to try to fix issues it was having on our Spot.Update: lowered review - after several attempts over time to contact the developer to have account linking issue resolved, I have not gotten a single response. In any case, it uses API that was recently acquired by Apple. This may mean the problem might be fixed by a more competent and responsive tech service team, or it may mean the skill is simply going to disappear outside the Apple app store."

Follow up issues:  I signed up for premium.

It works ok but when using maximum zoom the name of the city covers up most the area of interest. They need to incorporate a better map to overlay.  They need one with highways and rivers and other identifying marks on it.  That way it will be easier to figure out where you are in relation to any storms in the area.  They need to fix the zoom feature so that it is tighter and also fix it so the area of interest doesn't get covered up by the name of the nearest city.  The city name shouldn't zoom along with the map zoom. If they can do this, I'll resubscribe.  Other than that I found the skill very useful."

After purchasing the screensaver feature, I hoped it would show more information.  Screensaver comes with premium features, but it's still just current conditions with forecast for the next few hours.  It would have been great if it had that, and if the screensaver showed a relevant background picture as well as radar on the rotation.  It just rotates through various landscapes on the background."

B01GU4MBM4,Big Sky¬Æ,Weather,Judi Fryer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"GREAT SKILL, But STILL JUST THE BARE FACTS!","Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2017","I loved Alexa's weather information on my Amazon Dot because it was simple and to the point; unlike the TV weather.  However, there were times I needed just a little bit more information on a given day; particularly specifics about the rain or snow.  I would usually follow up the weather on the Dot by checking the 'Dark Skies' app on my phone on those particular days.  NOW, with BIG SKY on my Dot, I can just ask Alexa for 'the weather' or 'Big Sky' and not have to follow up on either with anything else.  'Big Sky 'has just the right information, including special Weather Warnings and Statements that you can ask for additionally, but without all the references to what the weather is doing in some other part of the country, or even the state, and how it will impact my area 'maybe' in a day or a week.  No fronts, depressions, etc. Weather reporting is barely accurate on a daily basis, much less a week ahead of time.  That being said, I would sometimes like tomorrow's projected weather on' Big Sky'.'  Tomorrow's weather, indeed a week's worth of weather, IS available on the 'Dark Sky' app and you can ask Alexa for tomorrow's, or even next weekend's, weather anytime.  There may be a way to get tomorrow's weather on 'Big Sky' on my Dot; but I either am overlooking that information or it hasn't be described to me how to ask Dot for it.  Anyone know the details?  If so, please leave a comment enlightening me.Otherwise, if you like straightforward weather that includes a few more details than Alexa's streamlined weather I highly recommend thie 'Big Sky' skill."

I am not positive but if you start to set it up on your phone and then switch to the computer it may make it lock up, it appears to have done that for me.  After working with the developer to free it up it is now working fine.It's pretty good and gives good in depth detail for the local area.  If you have it open on both your phone and computer try clearing it out of the phone, remove the card completely from the phone and finish it on the computer and it should work okay, it did for me. You may need to open another new account to do this.  Now I am not positive on all of that but it worked for me.So far so good thanks to the developer."

Big Sky is orders of magnitude better. It gives you super-detailed forecasts for your specific location. It can tell you, for instance, exactly when the rain will start or stop right where you are, and it's amazingly accurate. It's like the Dark Sky phone app. I'd like to say something negative about it to sound more balanced, but I honestly can't think of anything. Big Sky is essential and irreplaceable."

It's amazing how accurate the alerts for rain are. So, I decided to give Big Sky a try. It's very good! But the usability will be improved over time, I'm sure. What would I like to see?  1. Being able to set Big Sky as the default/primary weather app. 2. When an alert is announced - also say what the alert is without further interaction being necessary.

What I hate is that it was giving us ""notifications"" and ""weather alerts"" for Albuquerque, NM... which is an hour south of us, a lower elevation than Santa Fe, and whose weather is not remotely similar to ours. We would be sleeping at 3 AM when these ""alerts"" would be announced in our bedroom! I eventually learned how to shut off these irrelevant ""alerts"". But we both lost lots of sleep hearing about the weather in Albuquerque, NM! There was no warning that Santa Fe would get snow last night... only that Albuquerque (!) might get freezing temperatures. Thank goodness it doesn't tell us that it'll be hot and humid in Florida or cold in Alaska!"

Literally.i like the option of setting up custom alerts  since we live in West Texas where it does freeze occasionally And the alert can remind me to turn on our pool heater.Much better than the standard Alexa weather and the premium  version is well worth the dollar per month (80 cents for us Amazon Prime users).Edifying to see that customer great customer service still exists

We didn't made the change. Either we unintentionally said something that Alexa misunderstood, or somehow the change happened without our consent. Now, my routines that have weather do not work. Weather using Big Sky must be last. Any step after it will. or work. Buuuut... a custom Alexa skill has to be the last step in a routine. I tried disabling the skill and reenabling. That didnt work. I tried telling Alexa to forget Big Sky as the default weather and she didnt know wtf I was talking about. I disabled the skill, which is unfortunate because I use it all the time."
B01GU4MBM4,Big Sky¬Æ,Weather,Michael McLachlan,5.0 out of 5 stars,I‚Äôm not experincing issues others report,"Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2021","I‚Äôve been using Big Sky for well over two years and am happy with its performance. I rarely experience problems; it seems to be a stable app.Early on I did have issues with it disconnecting, but that problem seems to have been fixed some time ago. No linking issues with any Echo devices. I don‚Äôt have Echo Show so can‚Äôt comment on that.Weather accuracy is on par with other apps I use. Even among those apps, the current temperature or forecast can vary by 2-3 degrees so if I wanted more accurate reporting, I probably would need to deploy my own weather staion in the backyard and link it to Weather Underground.I thought the Big Sky skill used to be available in the Flash Briefing skill. I haven‚Äôt used Flash Briefing for a few months. That is a big miss if it has been dropped but you can add other weather skills to Flash Briefing.Personally, I don‚Äôt see a reason why a person rates Big Sky with one star simply because it doesn‚Äôt integrate with Flash Briefing. Just open Big Sky before or after the Flash Brief. Really, it is no big deal.The skill itself is useful. I opted for the more detailed forecast. I would think one could just as easily opt for less.I never get prompted to upgrade to the Premium service.Happy with the skill and one I use everday, sometimes more than once."

B01GU4MBM4,Big Sky¬Æ,Weather,S.L.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Too many bothersome lengthy ads,"Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2020","I would only get weather info about half the time.  The rest of the time I had to wait through long bothersome ads for the premium version I don't want. I would say ""Open Dark Sky"" expecting to at least eventually get detailed weather information as I got ready to leave for work or make outdoor plans -- But all I would get is an aggravating advertisement for the premium version of the app.  Seriously, only the plug for the premium version and not even any weather info.  The developers don't even reward you for slogging through their ad by giving you what you asked for.  It would run through a pitch for the premium version and then end with ""Would you like to active Dark Sky Premium?"" So even after waiting for the pitch to finish you still don't get the information you wanted in the first place.  This renders the app completely useless a significant percentage of the time. This eventually got so frustrating that I disabled it completely and if I could uninstall it I would do so.  It's not worth the headache, the juice isn't worth the squeeze.  I understand that the authors want to make some money but the way they're going about it is the surest way I can think of to get people to abandon their product completely.  There's a lot of weather services out there, you're probably not going to think this one is so good that you can't live without the premium version and you're probably going to get sick of the sales pitches like I did.This betrays a lack of understanding of basic marketing.  Rather than encourage people to stay with the product and hope they eventually see the advantages of the paid premium version they are bludgeoning people with their premium version ads and driving them out of contact with the product completely. Every time someone launches Dark Sky there's a hope and a chance they might find enough value in it to pay for the premium version but for someone like me who has been driven away from the product in frustration there's no chance at all.  Exposure goes to zero and there's not even a chance that I would use it in front of a friend or acquaintance who might become interested.  This is a recipe for failure."

Big Sky's answers to weather related questions are useful mini weather reports. This skill is definitely worth using if you want a little more than default answers for weather related questions.

On Echo Show this is fantastic.Taking into account that Amazon agressively blocks setting the location of an Echo to anything outside US they should add another setting into Alexa app (as they added Timezone) - ""Weather forecast location"" and integrate Big Sky as their main weather forecast. Dammit, buy out the devs, this is just brilliant.One minor grief though - similarly to some other weather forecasts the wind speed is indicated in nonsensical units for Europeans (angry glance towards wunderground). Hearing that wind will be ""13.4 km/h"" I have to do quick calculation in my head to get the ""real"" windspeed, that is 3.7 m/s in this case. Seriously, nobody measures wind in km/h, please add this to setting in some future. m/s should be default for metric settings.Otherwise - like said, BRILLIANT."
B01GU4MBM4,Big Sky¬Æ,Weather,Anjan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works like it is supposed to - excellent!,"Reviewed in the United States on August 13, 2019",Great app! All free features work accurately. Others who are claiming that it does not work well please note that it will give weather for the postal address you set up for your Alexa device; if this different from your current location then it would not be accurate for your current location. Others who are comparing temperatures with other weather apps should note that Big Sky report is hyper local - meaning it is more accurate than other weather reports since it uses weather stations much closer to your postal address than other weather reports that uses weather station from your nearest airport - Big Sky weather report is more accurate!

I just enabled permission to send me severe weather alerts. Bravo!!!I'd give it minus 0.5 points because in the past, you could ask ""What's the weather in {another place}?"" and that's gone now. It just ignores the location you give it and tells you your local weather. I travel out of state relatively frequently and it was great to ask while I was packing.

I opened my e-mail to find a note from Big Sky saying they were ""sorry to see me go"" and they would cancel my Premium account as requested.  I did not cancel my Premium account and have no idea how this happened.  It's possible I inadvertently did it with one of my many oral and typed requests attempting to fix other issues.  In any event, I signed back up again but this alone has not settled my problem which is:  In trying to delete a Premium location (which should be simple and straightforward) I said: ""Alexa tell Big Sky to change my options.  She responded:  ""I sent a card to the Alexa app.  Click on ‚ÄúLink account‚Äù to change your Big Sky options"".  Where in Gods name is ‚ÄúLink Account‚Äù?

No yellow ring, no comment from Alexa that I have a notification, no verbal or visual (I have a Spot as well as 2 Dots) notification that an alert has been issued.

Good skill for Alexa.,"Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2017",The possible issue regarding limiting the number of inquiries has been resolved. Usage is unlimited.The weather information has been thorough and accurate.  It's nice to know just when precipitation will begin and/or when to expect the high temperature. Having relative humidity is a major plus over other apps. Hopefully they might consider adding the dew point also in the future.Questions regarding the skill have been addressed very quickly and efficiently by the developer. I recommend this for everyone including my son-in-law who is a meteorologist.

I catch the bus almost daily and I ask Big Sky for the report as I'm getting ready so I know how to dress, whether to add layers, and whether to bring an umbrella. I swear if it says it will rain in 45 minutes, you will feel the first drop in 40 to 50 minutes. It is always accurate to a 10 minute window (at least where I live) and I don't know how anyone could give it a bad rating.

B01GU4MBM4,Big Sky¬Æ,Weather,Jim,2.0 out of 5 stars,So much superior information in an inferior skill,"Reviewed in the United States on June 8, 2018","This app gives so much information which is great. Humidity, barometric pressure, wind speed, etc.  However, on the Echo Show, it only displays a fraction of that information even though it speaks all of it. Plus, it has what data it displays on the right side of the screen and you have to swipe to scroll to see it all. But!  when you swipe, Alexa stops talking. Very frustrating.The most frustrating part is the premium subscription. Great price at less than $2/year, but it‚Äôs not even worth that. I‚Äôve had to sign up for it 3 times until it finally worked. Then, it lets you set 4 labeled locations with only 1 line for the address.  Not sure what format is required for it to recognize the address, but there‚Äôs no way for me to try again when the 2 I added didn‚Äôt work. That screen is not in the skill settings, so the only way to add or change an address is to delete the skill and sign up all over again. That‚Äôs just not acceptable for one of the Alexa Skill store‚Äôs featured skills."

Not as accurate as I'd like, but hey, it's the weather and if they are off a few degrees, oh well. For under a buck per month, I'll use it, especially if they use Dark Sky in their development.We live in the foothills of one of the many passes in the USA. Weather can go from 70 degrees to 40 degrees in a 15 minute time span and I've found Big Sky to be right in the ballpark most times."
B01GU4MBM4,Big Sky¬Æ,Weather,Captain Packrat,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Skill works well, but Dark Sky is terribly inaccurate","Reviewed in the United States on March 5, 2018","The skill itself works extremely well.  It does exactly what it says it does.  It's also nice that it gives information that the stock Alexa weather app does not, such as NWS watches and advisories.BUT...  The problem I have is with the data source, Dark Sky.  It is TERRIBLY inaccurate.  Today it predicted 1-3 inches of snow this afternoon.  We've had barely a flake all day.  Early this morning it claimed the rain would stop in 3 minutes, but it continued all morning.  I've also had it claim it would snow when there wasn't a cloud in the sky!"

B01GU4MBM4,Big Sky¬Æ,Weather,Anne,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Big screen (TV) support - works, but have to manually turn on the TV","Reviewed in the United States on February 4, 2019","The real strength of this skill is providing info on screen, augmenting the voice response. However, when we use it in our family room (via Alexa on our FireTV Cube), the only way to get the weather info on the screen is to manually turn on the TV first, which no one actually does. So the skill is handicapped and only provides weather info via voice. The skill should turn on the TV and present the info just like it does on smaller screens like the Echo Show in the kitchen."

It gives a very detailed forecast, if you like that sort of thing, or a more basic one for those who want just the ‚Äúhighlights‚Äù. It notifies you of any weather watches or advisories currently applicable to your specific location. It also gives the seven day forecast if you ask it too. You can get the forecast for a specific time of day as well. It‚Äôs a great skill to have with Alexa for those of us in areas prone to severe weather.Be aware of some leaving negative reviews based on their own personal error(s) while using/setting up the skill. It absolutely measures temps in C and F. You just have to tell it which you prefer when linking your account. Of course some fool gave it a negative review based on their belief it doesn‚Äôt measure in anything other than Farenheit.

It would speak in a heavy Spanish accent and say something like, ""The high today will be sesenta y siete, and the low tonight will be cuarenta y cuatro."" So it isn't accessible to someone who speaks only Spanish or English, you have to know both. What were they thinking? I removed Big Sky and went back to Alexa's more limited weather reports, because you can ask in Spanish and it answers in Spanish, or ask in English and get an answer in English."

This is at least the second time it's stopped working for weeks and I've only had it for 3-4 months. Alexa doesn't recognize any commands that refer to to Big Sky and while it shows in the the Alexa App under the skill section, if you tap on it the Alexa app just crashes.

B01GU4MBM4,Big Sky¬Æ,Weather,Jeff,1.0 out of 5 stars,It was a great app - until it hijacked my weather and broke my routines,"Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2022","This was a great app until about 2 weeks ago (March 2022), just say 'Alexa, ask Big Sky for the weather' and you would get your detailed weather. If you wanted something shorter OR IF YOU WANT TO GET THE WEATHER IN A ROUTINE, then 'Alexa, what's the weather' worked just fine for a brief overview. However, I now get Big Sky no matter how I ask for the weather, and IT BROKE ALL MY ROUTINES with weather in them because it starts up Big Sky which ends the routine. You can, I suppose, put the weather last. But that's not where I want it, and it also means I can not ask for my package statuses (which must be last in a routine). Boo and hiss. I've Googled and tried pretty much everything to no avail. I ended up deleting the Big Sky app - now I get the original weather and all my routines are working again. But if I re-install Big Sky, it just hijacks everything again."

If you don't ask for a featured camera within like 5 seconds of seeing the webcam she is displaying, she apparently closes Earth Cam. If you wait any longer she'll tell you she can't find that device. Otherwise you can watch the same webcam for however long, but if you want to change you have to tell her to open Earth Cam again."

For show me a sunrise, sunset, featured camera or something cool to work, you have to ask Alexa while she is still talking when you first open Earthcam.  If you want to change cameras you have to close Earthcam and reopen it.  Would like to be able to watch one of my favorite cameras or at least choose from a list of the featured cameras.

Even some of the major cities web cams it either doesn't have access to or, Alexa doesn't understand. So, it randomly picks an alternate location.

That is if I don't disable the skill on my end first."

B073ZFW1WX,Should I Wear Shorts ?,Weather,Skyfoxmarine,5.0 out of 5 stars,Useful and Funny!,"Reviewed in the United States on June 20, 2021","I love that this feature was both useful and funny. I was confused about why it would be a skill you needed to add until i used it. You could always ask this question before but it wouldn't have come up with a witty or snarky response.  For those that are complaining about language; but not only does it warn you about the language, it's your own fault for not turning on the setting that blocks offensive word use (or for turning it off because the default setting is on). This would be under either the main settings or your profile tab, I don't recall which. I also believe that there's a separate setting for the phone app, and Alexa device, although you can probably just tell your Alexa device: Alexa, always block offensive language please. Regardless, crotch goblin person said it best... unless you happen to live in Utah where bad words (I'm using bad sarcastically, but the review refuses to allow me to use quotations) will make a crowd of people turn and look at you like you have 3 heads and/or grown a nice pair of leathery wings."

B07J55Q4BN,MyRadar,Weather,StellarView,3.0 out of 5 stars,Almost a Good Skill,"Reviewed in the United States on August 26, 2019","I've been using this on my phone, comp and tablet for years so When I saw that there was a skill for Echo Show, I was elated...then I opened It and was deflated. It was just a static image with no zoom capabilities and showed the entire U.S. so I stopped using the skill until I opened it again today and saw that they listened to the people's suggestions and was again happy until I tried to look at the radar  through the big gray current weather window and Zoom buttons that never go away. I tried to click on the map behind them to see if that would make them disappear but Nope...it didn't. When they make it so that the map is the only thing on the screen and I can Pinch Zoom in and out, it will be the perfect skill. I have no doubts that they will fix it as they are really good at listening to and addressing the customer's complaints and/or suggestions. One last thing, if you could make the map stay on the screen until I make it go back home, that would be great because a lot of times when the weather is bad I open this app on my Tablet, computer or phone and leave it on so I can keep an eye on it until the bad weather has passed which can be hours. Once these things are changed I will update and change my review and rating."

But the Alexa for windows app will not display radar when using the voice command ""Alexa, ask MyRadar to show me the radar.""I have the MyRadar app installed on multiple devices including my phone, a FireTV stick, and my windows 10 PC.When using said voice command on my phone or FireTV stick, radar is displayed... However, when using said voice command on the Alexa app for windows she responds ""Radar display is not supported on this device, please try another request.""Considering all that's needed here is a display screen... and obviously my PC has one... Why has the skill developer not allowed this function to work through the Alexa app for windows?And before you ask... Yes, I have discussed this trend with Amazon's Alexa support team. They are stating it is the duty of the skill developer to enable these features.Same trending issue with Arlo skill. Alexa app for windows states ""Sorry, cameras don't work on this device."" when using the voice command ""Alexa, show me the front door.""

B07J55Q4BN,MyRadar,Weather,Zach Lies,1.0 out of 5 stars,Show skill broke the Fire TV app!,"Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2018","I have been using the MyRadar app for Fire TV for years. It lacks the (minimal and generally poor) forecast, and other bells and whistles of the Android version, but looks better on a bigger screen, especially with the wind layer enabled. It also added Alexa voice integration when that rolled out to FireTV in 2016, allowing me to launch it just by saying, ""Alexa, open My Radar,"" and even play/pause the loop animation with voice commands.  Once the skill for Echo Show came out, however, all that awesomeness went away.  Play/pause via voice is completely gone, and to launch it now, you need to say, ""Alexa, open My Radar on Fire TV,"" and sometimes that doesn't even work.  I don't have an Echo Show, so why is this skill even available to other Echo devices? All it does is break their previously great (and free/ad-free, BTW) Fire TV app."
B07J55Q4BN,MyRadar,Weather,AirTog,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good, but ..... want to see the radar not current conditions","Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2022","It's a nice app to show the weather radar, but it also displays a current conditions window box that blocks HALF the radar screen image.  Really dumb - here's why:  For us on the east US coast, putting a window of current conditions on the left side of the radar map screen blocks what's coming to us from the west (normal weather flow) and shows mostly the ocean to the east on the right side.  PLEASE give an option to disable current conditions window within the app as it's not the reason why we want myradar -- we want to see the radar image for our area.  We already know the current conditions!"

I got this app to see the local weather radar. You would think ""alexa, my radar"" would do that ... but you must say ""alexa, ask my radar to show me the radar"". I'm retired, I can't even remember that long a phrase !! I may have to stick a post it note to the screen to remember. After all we got the app to see a radar picture, that's where I want to go directly! After I'm at the radar screen, I can always ask for other weather data. Also it would be very nice if you could choose how long you want the radar screen to persist and if it would remember the last zoom setting."

Alexa is constantly unable to open skill. But when it works its great.

Even with all the issues it‚Äôs still my favorite skill I use daily. Fix the issues and it would a success..
B07J55Q4BN,MyRadar,Weather,Madman ,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Like this skill so far, except for the intro monologue","Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2021","Just got an Echo Show 8 and am enjoying this app.  Very useful for watching the bands of weather rolling in as they tend to do in my area.I would love to have a ""quiet start"" option added to this skill, so when it starts up it goes straight to the radar screen without the long monologue of weather information.  I assume it was written for the non-show devices, but it isn't needed on the shows.  I want to use this in the morning to check the weather, but the long (30+ second) monologue disturbs my family."

Just enabled this skill, and promptly got a display of thunderboomers all around me in central Texas. I asked it to first zoom in to Austin, it did, so then I said zoom in to Lago Vista, Texas and it did that as well.  Initially I was put off because Alexa displayed bars for temperature and such, obscuring the radar view behind but after 5 seconds or so they went away and only the radar from NOAA was showing.  Just got curious as I was typing this, told Alexa, ""Myradar for Miami, Florida, and it did. Showed the hurricane on approach, and Alexa offered to zoom in or out, so I said, ""Zoom out"", and darn if it didn't show me the radar down towards cuba!  Nothing to gripe about, other than the default for displaying is about 10 or 15 seconds and then it goes off.  Hence the pathetic 4 stars instead of 5.  :)"

B07J55Q4BN,MyRadar,Weather,Dan Schneider,2.0 out of 5 stars,not put together very well,"Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2021",well it does show radar and weather. The radar has no transparency so you can't see anything under the big white splotch covering 3 states. Asking Alexa to Zoom in results in a reboot 90% of the time. The +/- doesnt zoom in. not that it matters because if there is anything on the radar you can't see anything on the map as previously mentioned.

Then, if you want, tell Alexa to ""turn on weather alerts"" and Alexa will then give alerts for current location. I wish Alexa would ask, after you update the device location, if you'd like to change this alert but unfortunately she does not. This was driving me nuts and is finally fixed. Thanks Kevin!"

If you‚Äôre like me, you want the high and low temperatures and weather or not it will rain, am i right?  This app will tell me the temps, but wont tell me if it will rain. If i ask, ‚ÄúAlexa, is it raining today‚Äù, then ill get information on how many inches to expect and what time to expect it.  it would be great if the weather fuction included that info as a default."
B01JHLFTJO,Weather,Weather,G. McQ,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works Very Well,"Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2016","It's been working perfectly for me. Like others have said it would be nice if Alexa also gave wind speed, but that is probably something that will be coming in the future. It would also be nice to be able to ask follow-up questions on the weather once Alexa gives you the general weather. Things like relative humidity, expected snow accumulation, etc. Again, all these features will come as the technology gets updated.Lots of people saying it gives them The wrong location for their weather. This is because they didn't set their location in Alexa's settings. Once you do that it gives you the correct weather location. This is also true for the temperature. People are shocked when they hear the wrong temperature, but that's because they probably have it set for centigrade when they want it in Fahrenheit or vice versa."

So THANK YOU to the last reviewer, because their suggestions worked for me. Might seem obvious, but just in case - first, you have to be on the phone of the account holder for the Echo. A subsidiary account member will not work to override the settings. Once I was on the account owner‚Äôs phone and in the Alexa app, I went to Devices - All Devices - Alexa on this Phone. Changing that one address under Alexa on this Phone was the only one that mattered - none of the other addresses I‚Äôve changed on either of our phones anywhere in the Alexa app fixed the issue. Hope this helps someone else who has been losing their mind over weather alerts from a town they left because they hated everyone there. Amazon, ruining my weather alerts since 2020."

This issue seriously needs to be addressed and fixed in the app.  Moved to Florida 4 months ago and have been woken up to Winter Storm Warnings from up North despite having changed every Alexa Device to our new location.  Actually missed a Tornado Warning that hit very near to us due to this issue.  It sure would have been nice to actually get that heads up instead of waking up to a solar panel blown off the roof, a trellis ripped out by the wind along with other wind damage.

However, you have to listen closely so that you can translate Alexa's speech to normal English. For instance, she gives me the weather for Atlanta, GA but pronounces the state abbreviation as ""gah."" Sure, it's not the end of the world but you'd think that the text-to-speech programming would have included the fifty states' and the territories' abbreviations so it wouldn't throw the listener for a loop. Here, it's kind of funny to have her say ""Atlanta...GAH!!!"" like she's frustrated with Atlanta but it might not be so funny elsewhere.

This is the second or third weather skill I tried to enable today as the AccuWeather skill is a day behind in it's forecast....and none of them have worked.  All send some type of error message.  Is this intentional so only AccuWeather gets used?  R they partners so they make sure other weather skills don't work or are these weather skill companies just unable to make smart skills to work correctly?"

I hate that I have to say which airport everyday and that it reads it back to me. I'd like to be able to save airport favorites and have them displayed on my Echo Show that way I can just select multiple airports I may fly to for the day and have them displayed quickly with TAF lines.

It's pretty cool to ask Alexa for my METAR when I wake up to see what the weather is at the airport.Just a couple of suggestions, and I don't know if they're possible, but would be nice of they could be implemented. First, is it possible to get Alexa to recognize the phonetic alphabet? I have tried over a dozen times to get the weather for KCXP, and she always replies that she can't find a METAR for KCXC. She hears KMEV correctly, but seems to have an issue with P. Second, is there a way to pause for a second between elements? It is awesome that she gives the measurements in different units (SM / KM) but I find I have to listen a few times because she'll go through too quickly.Otherwise, very cool skill! Thank you!"

After multiple attempts of getting an international airport weather I gave up and disabled this skill. I doubt the author of this skill app is a pilot.It is also very wordy and clumsy to have to say word perfectly &quot;Alexa, Give me Aviation Weather for Metar for XXXX&quot;  It would be far more easier to say and remember to say simply  &quot;Alexa metar for XXXX&quot;"

First it needs to understand the phonetic alphabet. Alexa doesn't understand KIXD. She gives me KIAS or KIAS no matter how many times or how slow I speak. Another thing to add would be for Alexa to ask if you want Translated or Raw metar. I would give it more stars but I can't get my local airport weather.
